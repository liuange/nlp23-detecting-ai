113,3151,"How do chinese people Alphabetize ? EDIT : Oh shit , I need to get bored in class more often . Please explain like I'm five.","Long time lurker , first time poster . So let 's get started shall we ? I speak Mandarin as my second language , and am more familiar with the simplified version . There are two types of Mandarin : simplified and traditional . Trust me , the traditional version is much more convoluted than the simplified one . Firstly , in Mandarin , there is probably no equivalent of alphabetization , at least not in the conventional way . This is n't really surprising , since the characters descended from pictograms - images that convey a message . Thus , you can see that Mandarin characters more closely resemble pictures , rather than the normal alphabets that we see in English . Now then , how do we depict Mandarin characters ? Most simple characters consist of a left side and a right side . In some cases , both sides tell a story . For example , the character 话 is made up of 言(this is the traditional version of the left side ) and 舌 . The left tells us that this word is related to speech , since 言 means speech . The right is the character for the tongue . Put them together , and you get the character for the English equivalent of word . Speech from the tongue = word . Then again , it is n't always so simple . For some characters , only one side tells a story . I 'll take the example raised by /u / pudmedcentury . 姐 is made up of 女 and 且 . 女 tell us that this character is referencing to something feminine . However , as far as I know , 且 does not give any meaning to 姐 . For the record , 姐 means older sister , which addresses the feminine portion . Some characters operate in a different way - up and down . The character 烫 which means hot or scalded , is made up of 汤(soup ) and 火(fire ) . In the past , people probably got scalded by hot soup most frequently , leading to this character . Fire + soup = hot ( or if you are unlucky , scalded ) . There are many more orientations to Mandarin characters , including single words ( e.g. 人 which means person ) , top - left - right ( e.g. 森 which means forest ) , left - top - bottom ( e.g. 祸 which means disaster ) . As usual , some parts have meaning , some parts do n't ( as far as I know ) . There are just too many to list , and as such , I do n't think that Mandarin characters can be alphabetized in an English sort of way . How then do Mandarin dictionaries work ? Every character has a pronunciation , which is translated to English alphabets . So 森 is sen , 人 is ren , 烫 is tang . Basically , all the characters are arranged in alphabetical order , which makes the foundation of the dictionary . However , every translation normally has 4 tones . In Mandarin we call them 声(shēng ) , or sound . In speech , the 4 tones of the same translation sound different , with each tone having many characters . So 汤(tāng - first tone ) , 堂(táng - second tone ) , 躺(tǎng - third tone ) , 烫(tàng - fourth tone ) all sound different and have different meanings , 堂 , 糖 , 塘 , 膛 ( táng ) all sound the same , but have different meanings . Characters in dictionaries are first arranged by alphabets , and within same translations , arranged by tones . This is probably the closest that we have to alphabetization in Mandarin . There are many more aspects to Mandarin , like the fifth tone ( ü ) and the sequence to writing Mandarin characters . This is an incredibly complex language to learn with an incredibly large amount of vocabulary . Feel free to ask any questions or correct any mistakes that I made , or even to ask for the meaning of any characters that I used .",Fake,Real,0.6297897696495056,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1,0,0
114,3203,"Why is n't it considered corruption when politicians grant access to lobbyists in return for financial gain . EDIT : Since lobbyists give campaign donations and receive access to politicians in return , why is n't this considered corruption ? Please explain like I'm five.","Short answer : it depends on the country . I try to answer this without bringing my own opinion into it : Most countries have some forms you could ( depending on your opinions ) call legal corruption . For example : some democracies have non - professional parliaments - that means that the law - makers have their own job and business and only go to the parliament twice a year or so ( Switzerland would be an example for such a system ) . This means , of course , that these politicians have economical interests . You could argue , that this is some kind of corruption , since these guys will vote for their interests . On the other hand , people who vote them into the parliament know this . A teacher might vote for another teacher and a farmer for another farmer - since they know they will have roughly the same interests . In the US it is legal to donate for political campaigns - but you have to do so un - anonymously . So you are free to see , who finances Obama and who finances Romney . So the idea would be , that you could look up the donators which would tell you , which interests the politician will represent .

Please explain like I'm five.","The human species also lives longer life cycles than almost all other mammalian species . What we would consider ' early ' to stop out reproductive cycles . Many of our mammalian peers have long died , if born at the same time . Another theory is that since males typically lived shorter and usually had more violent deaths than females , we selected for a earlier termination timeframe for females because older females had to also step in and care for the young within a kingroup . The concept of universal grandmothering and grandfathering became essential for a kingroup over time . This practice solidified their second generation versus this age group still having children that would outcompete their childrens children . As somebody already stated , the fact that men can still pass genome , with younger women , at older age still ensures basic survival incase of a severe calamity .

199,5475,"how are unpaid internships still legal ? I know universal just got sued because of this . But how , even for credit ( which most people have to pay for ) , is this practice still legal . Please explain like I'm five.","It mostly is n't . As other commenters have said , but I will sum up : In the United States in order for an "" employer "" to legally have you on unpaid , you must either be a volunteer or a trainee . There is a strict test from the department of labor on what it means to be legally an unpaid trainee , which almost no real - life unpaid interns actually meet . You can find it [ here ] ( URL_0 ) along with friendly explanations . To be a volunteer , it is unclear what the precise boundaries are , but there are certain rules such as : * You ca n't "" volunteer "" for profit - generating work at a for - profit company . * It is illegal for an employer to have you volunteer to do something you were formerly paid for , or are sometimes paid for ( they ca n't pay you for 20 hours and have you work for 40 , and claim the other 20 are "" volunteering "" ) . * It is illegal for them to condition receipt of a job on "" volunteering "" for them first . So , the follow - up to your question is , given that most unpaid internship programs are actually illegal , why are they still so prevalent ? Here are some answers . * There 's no "" internship cops "" running around policing them . In order to be held illegal , they must be challenged . * Many people take these internships because they believe it will help get them recommendations , references , networking , etc . , in order to find a job . All of that gets shot to hell if you file a complaint . Most people would rather tolerate 4 months of unpaid work than have their career prospects . * Most interns do n't know they are illegal , ( reasonably ) figuring that if they are so prevalent they must be legal . Many small employers are also in this situation . Large employers like Fox Searchlight probably know it 's illegal but think they can get away with it . To those answering something like "" it 's my time , I can do what I want with it "" : * Nobody would be punishing interns , they 'd punish employers . * Illegal internship programs undermine the market for paid work , and undercut laws like the minimum wage . * Few people really * * want * * to work for no pay .

Please explain like I'm five.,"It 's a fuzzy concept . Cultural appropriation generally occurs when someone from a position of privilege ( like white people in the US ) pick and choose elements of other groups to incorporate in their life because they are "" cool "" or "" exotic "" . This is generally done in a way that is not respectful towards the culture where those elements originated . For example : a fashion photo shoot with white models wearing Native American headdresses . The cultural element is taken out of context and used to convey an idea of wilderness or perhaps mystique because that is how a lot of people think of native People and their customes . Another example is western people wearing a bindi when they go clubbing . The key element is that these other cultures / groups have to give up a lot of their way of being ( be it clothes or way of speaking or something else ) to fit into mainstream society ( "" do n't speak like a black person if you want a job "" , "" you should wear western wear at the office ) which is basically designed around the most privileged group . Picking and choosing elements of other cultures because they are cool and then taking them out of context to promote your edginess is bad , learning about cultural elements in context and in a way that is respectful towards others is not .

"" Please explain like I'm five.","3D glasses work by presenting each of your eyes with a different image . Modern 3D glasses do this by being polarized . Specific , they use [ circular polarization ] ( URL_0 ) , which has only two directions , clockwise and counterclockwise . A polarized lens will only let through light that is polarized in the same direction . So to make the 3D effect work , one lens is clockwise - polarized , and one is counterclockwise - polarized . That lets them project two overlapping imaged on the screen at once , with the light for each image polarized to match the lens that its intended to be visible through . This means that the light for the image intended for your right eye will pass through the right lens , but be blocked by the left lens , and vice versa for the other eye . Ambient light is not polarized , but rather consists of lots of different photons that are all vibrating in many different ways . Some of this light will be blocked by the lenses in your glasses , and some will pass through them . The light that passes through a polarized lens will be only the light that matches the lens 's polarization , meaning that , when light passes through a polarized lens , the light coming out the other side only consists of light vibrating in the same direction : i.e. * it 's polarized * . So when you look in the mirror and close one eye , the light bouncing off your face on the closed - eye side passes through the lens on that side and becomes polarized . It then bounces off the mirror and toward your open eye , which is behind a lens that is polarized opposite from the opposite lens , and opposite from the light coming through that lens . And thus the light passing through the opposite lens is blocked , and it looks black .",Fake,Real,0.9994025230407716,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

254,6679,College admission essays . What are the best school looking for in essays / personal statements ? Explain like I'm five.,"Writing a successful college essay is 20 % writing skill / style , 20 % topic , and 60 % avoiding a mine field of cliches and phrases that will just piss your admissions officer off . Step 1 : Figure out what you 're good at . Pick three of these things . I 'll use myself as an example . I picked telling stories , writing lyrically , and soccer . Step 2 : Figure out what you enjoy . I picked listening to the radio , riding in the car , and New York City . Step 3 : The anecdote . Mine your personal history for something that combines at least 4 of these elements . It just has to be a glimmer of a memory . Mine was about driving around NYC on Passover listening to the baseball on the radio . Step 4 : ELABORATE . Write a full page describing everything you can about that memory . Step 5 : Edit step 4 . You 're going to want to cut that down to half a page . Step 6 : Jazz it up with something impressive . Ever had an internship ? Successfully interacted with an adult ? Read a cool book in an interesting way ? Relate that to your experience . * * You do n't have to discover the meaning of life but figure out some way that these things you like , things you 're good at , and experiences you have make you into someone that these people want on their campus . If they read your essay and feel like they could n't stand to be in a room with you for an hour , you 've done something wrong . * * tl;dr do n't come off like a prick . Step 7 : Make this fit onto one page . The margins do n't have to be crazy but if they do n't have to flip the page they do n't have that split second to realize how much you suck . Step 8 : Show it to people . You 're guidance counselor , your mom , your favorite english teacher , your best friend . They will give you advice . Feel free to ignore it but listen to what they have to say . If all of these people say you sound like a brown - nosed dick , you 've done something wrong . Step 9 : * * Put it down and focus on the other smaller elements of the application . * * When I met my admissions officer after I had been admitted to my top choice she said the main thing she remembered about my application was my list of books I had read recently . Step 10 : The step of don'ts . * * DO NOT * * talk about how a book that 's common on school reading lists changed your life ( Catcher in the Rye , Macbeth , Pride and Prejudice , Jane Eyre , The Scarlet Letter- these are essay killers . ) * * DO NOT * * write about that time you were in a car accident or that time you scored the winning goal or that time you hated high school ( note : if there is honestly something like a trauma that has affected your life significantly write a short piece about this and put it in the additional materials section . If your entire family died in a car crash and you had to switch schools and your grades dipped , the admissions people should know about it . ) * * DO NOT * * write about how hard it is to write this essay or about procrastination * * DO NOT * * write a witty , non - narrative , post - structuralist ode ( unless it 's great ) .",Fake,Real,0.6509718298912048,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Another reason is that humans expose themselves to a lot of bad things , that many animals in the wild do not .

Explain like I'm five.","[ Great music dictionary online . ] ( URL_0 ) The terms you 're asking about are often used interchangeably . There are however , specifics to consider : A scale is essentially a collection of notes in some kind of logical order . There are many possible scales , each with their own unique musical flavour . "" Key "" ( from Dolmetsch ): specific scales or series of notes defining a particular * tonality * , for example , certain keys may , on the basis of the sequence of successive intervals , be defined as major or minor and are then named after their tonic or key note Modes are ALMOST like scales ( in that they are more or less scales ) but are treated in their own special context . If we are in the * * key * * of A Major , we might play notes from the A Major * * scale * * . However , depending on the harmonic context , we may choose not to think "" tonally "" . For instance , if we 're playing a ii - V progression ( ad infinitum ) in A Major , we 're in "" modal "" harmonic territory . When improvising or writing in this context , it 's likely you would use B Dorian and E Mixolydian * * scales * * . These two scales have the exact same notes as an A Major scale ; they just start and end on notes other than the tonic ( B and E respectively ) . Because of this , they are referred to as * * modes * * of the A Major scale . They share the same notes , but are applied in their own unique manner . It 's also possible to hear a minor / major key referred to as a minor / major mode if the harmony is modal . Modal music has chord progressions that are characteristic of a certain mode and does not have any "" tonal "" references ( i.e. perfect cadences , tonicizations , etc . ) .",Fake,Real,0.5460404753684998,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Sure you can imagine two cats , or two forks , or whatever , but does two exist , outside of being an adjective applied to nouns ? What about the number pi ? It is n't even possible to have pi of anything ! The question is purely philosophical , but you should approach the complex numbers with the same mentality . We accept a concept of two and ignore the question of "" two what ? "" because the question is irrelevant , we can say wonderful things about two independent of the answer . Just like that , we can say wonderful things about 3 + 7i , regardless of whether you can actually have that many cats . The reason mathematicians came up with the complex numbers is because it is often convenient to consider them , if just as a means to a real end . For instance , there is a [ formula ] ( URL_0 ) for the roots of a cubic polynomial involving complex numbers , such a formula is impossible to write without using them , even if all the roots are real . They are in a very precise sense the natural completion of the real numbers because all polynomials of degree n have n roots in the complex numbers .

423,10367,Transubstantiation in Catholicism and why they believe it I can not fathom that an adult thinks he can turn wine and crackers into flesh and blood with a few magic words . Maybe I 'm misunderstanding something ... Explain like I'm five.,"What is transubstantiation ? Let 's break it down . Trans - obviously to change . Substance - that which stands under . In the time the word "" transubstantiation "" was formed , the word substance was not "" physically touchable stuff "" but "" essential nature , "" i.e. that which stands under the physical object , that facet of being which lies under the purely physical . So what does it mean to transubstantiate ? It should be obvious - to change the internal nature of some object , i.e. to alter its essential being in some way . Not to change the physical nature of the object , but to change the being which that physical body delimits . This is of course an old conception of being which is n't the same as the modern "" everything is just particles , "" but if you accept any dualist thought it 's pretty easy to see where transubstantiation can make sense . If you just think about one of the shitty paradoxes where if you replace the hilt of a sword then replace the blade is it still that thing , you can see where this sort of being fits naturally into what humans think . Basically , the modern conception of being equates it with extancy . The old Catholic sense of being also allows for the concept of substancy .",Fake,Real,0.6924511790275574,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

437,10667,"What is defragging my hard drive , and how will it help my computer ? This is probably a stupid question , but I know nothing about computers . Explain like I'm five.","hard drives contain 2 key parts : 1)read /write head : a sometimes magnetized pin that can move left and right . 2 ) platter : a metallic disk that holds the data . you can visualize the data with this simple analogy . imagine you have a very long thin glass tabletop . now pour tiny metallic shards in a straight line . hold a strong magnet over a small region of the long thin line of metallic shards . those metallic shards will stand up . they will stay standing up even after you remove the magnet . you just created a 1 ; create more 1s by you moving left and right at regular intervals . To make that 1 a 0 simply put the magnet on the underside of the glass table and the metallic shards will fall back in line with the rest of the shards . The glass table and the metal shards are the platter . You and your magnet are the read / write head . Crudely that is how a hard drive stores data . What does storing data on a hard drive have to do with defragging ? I thought you would never ask ! lets continue . When you store a file on your hard drive . That read / write head asks the filesystem to give it a spot on your platter to make a series of 1 and 0 to represent the file you want to write . When you want to read that file again the read / write head must lookup the location of the file in the filesystem(like a table of contents for the platter and outside the scope of this explanation ) . The filesystem then tells the read / write head what part or parts of the platter to go to to retrieve the file . Seems simple . Hard drives likes to put things in order just like you would if you had a 20 foot long glass table top with metal shards . Would n't you like to have that term paper you wrote in order when you went to retrieve it ? Or would you like to walk back and forth several times across your long thin table to get the term paper retrieved in the correct order ? That term paper would be worthless if the words were out of order . That is how you would obviously start . The term paper is in order , next you stop for the night and save some funny pictures on reddit and store that on your glass table with metal shards ( hard drive ) . You left some space to finish the term paper . So your good right ? The paper goes longer than expected ( rare I know ) but you add a works cited page and whatnot . Ok you ran out of space to retrieve that term paper in order . Now half the term paper is at that start of your hard drive ( glass table ) and the other half is near the end of the table . When you want to read /write to that term paper you have to keep track of 2 sections of that table . And walk double the distance . Hard drives ( or you with your magnet ) will will take longer to retreive files when they have to move all over the place to retrieve a file . Or for that matter a series of files commonly accessed at the same time . TL;DR – a fragmented hard drive is when the drive is no longer storing directories , files common accessed at the same time , or even single files in linear order . Its chopped up – fragmented . Defragging puts these commonly accessed files in a physically closer location location to each other . This reduces the actual distance the read write head must move .",Fake,Real,0.910161554813385,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Explain like I'm five.,"I 'm not completely up to date on it , but one of the mods changed the rules , so any posts that were solely images would be automatically deleted by a bot . He said images could be posted within self - posts . It was basically to stop the memes and karma - whoring using images that require little to no effort . Honestly I thought it was good for the sub , because it would have encouraged users to put thought into posts if they want karma in return , and could have restored a sub made for atheist discussion . However , many users are outraged and want their memes and images back with one click . A vote is being held I think , and so far the majority is in favour of returning to the old rules .",Fake,Real,0.6988838911056519,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

Explain like I'm five.,"The best way I found to think about it is like this : start with A^1 = A. A^2 is A * A. A^3 is A * A * A , ( or A^2 * A ) & so on . As you can see , each time you increase the power by 1 , you multiply by A again . In other words : A^n+1 = A^n * A. divide both sides by A & you get A^n = A^n+1 / A. If you let n=0 , you get A^0 = A^0 + 1 / A , which is A^0 = A^1 / A , which is A^0 = A / A , which is A^0 = 1 . So therefore , A^0 = 1 . * * * * * Edit : Bonus round for negative powers , if you 're interested . Now that we know A^0 = 1 we can do this : Using A^n = A^n+1 / A again . let n=-1 . A^-1 = A^-1 + 1 / A , which is A^-1 = A^0 / A , which is A^-1 = 1 / A. let n=-2 . A^-2 = A^-2 + 1 / A , which is A^-2 = A^-1 / A , which is A^-2 = ( 1 / A ) / A , which is A^-2 = 1 / A^2 This can be generalised to A^-n = 1 / A^n .",Real,Fake,0.6622008085250854,,,,,,,,,,0,1,1

For Japan , the war started at least in 1937 ( the second Sino - Japanese War ) , and by that point they had taken Manchuria and Korea , and were fighting battles in mainland China regularly . When it came to war with the US , The Japanese knew that the US would win in a full out war , so they designed the attack on Pearl Harbor to be so shocking that the US would just negotiate an end to the oil embargo on Japan . But the opposite happened and the US went into full attack mode . The Japanese used many of the smaller island battles as a possible chance for the last big , bloody battle that would finally get the US to negotiate an end to the war . But FDR had put into place a policy of unconditional surrender - meaning there was never going to be any negotiation , no matter how bloody the battles got . Like u / TheSecretMe said , the islands were strategic gold .

I 'm not sure that Detroit 's government is really in much of a position to be able going around writing tickets for that sort of thing . Also , often times , the owners of these sorts of houses are n't actually banks . They 're slum lords , many of whom likely do n't even live in the city .

Explain like I'm five.,"Well , there are the "" official "" reasons which probably do n't need summarizing because they are all over the news . The "" real "" reasons ca n't be known for sure because we do n't have access to internal government records , but there are several high profile foreign policy think tanks which look at this stuff in depth from the US governments perspective . One of the perspectives that has emerged is that it is actually in the US and Israeli interest ( for a number of reasons that need much more backstory ) if the civil war continues at a low boil over a number of years . Since the Assad regime has gained a clear upper hand over the last few months , a US led action of some sort might be able to erase the Assad advantage and allow the war to fall back into a stalemate . Another perspective is more in line with "" mainstream "" justifications . In particular , Obama took a risk by so boldly putting forward the idea of the "" red line "" as a way to bound or control the parameters of the conflict without direct involvement . If clear evidence exists that his "" red line "" has been crossed , then the administration feels it must take some action to "" maintain credibility "" . My opinion is that it is some combination of both of the above perspectives . It certainly is n't because the US feels a need to act forcefully against the use of chemical weapons . Even a quick look at the US 's history in the region over the last couple of decades has shown a recurring willingness to look the other way when allies make use of chemical weapons .",Fake,Real,0.9839698672294616,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

That stuff is called fascia . When you move , each little muscle strand moves and works together , it causes the fascia ( cellophane ) to rub . That friction causes the fascia to get stuck to itself and the surrounding fascia . If you get enough friction , the fascia causes the muscle to not move properly . This may cause discomfort or pain . Massage can sometimes break up these areas of knottiness . You can have someone massage the area or you can use tools like foam rollers to help . If you start with soft , light pressure , you may be able to get the muscle to relax and then through patience , get the fascia to not cling and relieve the problem . If you are too aggressive with the pressure to the area , you may cause the muscles to contract and not want to let go .

There is no definite amount of time that one element will take to decay into another the same way that there is no definite amount of coin tosses it would take to land a heads .

However , when you have an incredibly large amount of atoms together , the probability of decay can essentially be thought of as the "" average "" time of decay . The larger the sample size , the better the approximation . If you were to take the decay time of every individual atom of a sample and plotted it , it would essentially give a bell curve , with the half - life of that element being derived from the peak .

734,18519,Why do different engines require different viscosity lubricating oils ? Why do some engines use 5w-20 as opposed to 10w-20 or 20w-50 ? Explain like I'm five. ,"Engines are configured in different ways . Old flathead engines had all their moving parts near the oil pan . Oil did n't need to be pumped too far to get it where it needed to be . Also , clearances were looser in those engines , so a thicker ( more viscous ) oil was needed to keep the parts from wearing out prematurely . New engines have oiled parts ( e.g. camshafts ) farther away from the oil pan so the oil has to be easier to pump there . Thinner , less viscous oils work better here . Generally , you 'll find newer engines use 5W-30 or 5W-20 ( some even use 0W-20 ) oil where just a decade ago , 10W-30 was commonly used .

The larger the objects , the stronger the pull . Using the Earth and the Sun for an example , both the earth and the sun are pulling on each other at all times . They 're actually pulling on each other with the same amount of strength , but the sun is much more massive , so it does n't really move that much . The earth on the other hand moves a lot , so the earth looks like it 's orbiting the sun But now that we 've established that everything can pull on each other , let 's imagine that there 's a tiny satellite next to the earth . It 's small enough that it does n't really have any pull on the earth or the sun , but it is influenced by both the earth and the sun . The lagrange point is the location where , if a satellite were placed , the pull of gravity from the earth and the pull of gravity from the sun as the earth orbits the sun would keep that satellite in the same place relative to the earth . So it would orbit with the same period around the sun as the earth does . Let 's draw a circle , with the sun at the very center and the earth on the edge somewhere . Now draw a line from the earth to the sun , and draw a point somewhere on that line closer to the earth than the sun . As the earth moves around the circle , so does the line .

806,21268,What was grocery shopping like before scanning ? was it really slow for people buying stuff in bulk ? how did they handle it back then ? Explain like I'm five.,"I remember this from when I was a kid . Each item was tagged with the price of that item . So when people were adding things to the shelves they would also use the label maker to add the price tags . For bulk items like fruit and similar things you would not tag each item but the cashers would have a price list for the item . A good casher would be able to type the prices into the register at the same speed as average modern cashers who use the scanner . The main disadvantage of this was that it was harder to get a receipt as it was easier to just type the price and not the product name . So most people did not bother with a receipt or just got receipt for "" misc groceries "" . It was not that bad for the customers but the problem was that the shop did not know how much they were selling of different items and therefore not how much they had left and how much they had to order . A shop owner would spend a lot of time counting stock and judging how popular different items were so that he could plan for how much he had to order . This is the main reason why they changed to using barcodes . Now they know exactly what products are being sold at what shop and at what time . A lot of times they even know who bought the product . So they have a lot more control and can do more informed decisions when ordering products and for marketing .",Real,Fake,0.7229824662208557,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0

It usually only tells you "" your username or password is incorrect . "" Explain like I'm five. ","A side point I have n't seen anyone else mention yet : While it 's good to return the same error message whether the username or password was wrong , there 's another security consideration to take into account here : the time it takes to return that error . Imagine you 're an attacker trying to brute force combinations on a website . All you know is whether the combination worked or not and how long it took for you to get the message . If the validation code looks something like this , then you can figure out more information than they intended ( bolded lines are where a message is printed ): 1 . Check if user exists 2 . * * If user does n't exist , print error * * 3 . Get user 's password 4 . Compare user 's password with entered password 5 . * * If both passwords match , print success * * 6 . * * Otherwise , print error * * Looking at that logic , you can see that the error caused by an incorrect username is printed much earlier than the error caused by an incorrect password . Also keep in mind that password validation both takes a lot longer than simply comparing two usernames ( so long as passwords are even somewhat properly stored ) and always takes roughly the same amount of time . Because of this , if you can observe the timing of your requests , then you can determine , regardless of the text of the error message , whether the username you entered exists or not . This is called a timing attack , and security experts generally recommend mitigating it by always doing every step of the verification . Compare the above logic to this logic , which is n't vulnerable to the same timing attack : 1 . Check if user exists 2 . If user does n't exist : 1 . Get the string "" doesn'tmatter "" from the database 3 . Compare entered password to this string 2 . * * Print error * * 3 . Get user 's password 4 . Compare user 's password with entered password 5 . * * If both passwords match , print success * * 6 . * * Otherwise , print error * * If you 're unfamiliar with databases and how passwords are stored , just know that step 2.1 is necessary in case of a database that takes a while to respond . Anyway , in this new one , we actually validate the entered password against an arbitrary string in the case the username 's incorrect and then discard the result . Because of this , it should always take effectively the same amount of time to get all three options , leaving an attacker with no indication of whether a user exists or not .",Fake,Real,0.9997878670692444,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Please explain like I'm five.,"This is a debate about net neutrality , and there is absolutely no other way to paint this than as the classic capitalism vs. socialism & market controls debate that every first - year economics student encounters . For example , if we allowed a market for organs , strictly more people needing organs would get them . But it would be unfair ( only the rich would receive organ donations ) , and it would incentivize undesirable things ( illegal organ harvesting ) . Therefore , as a society we seemed to have agreed that we want to set a price ceiling for organs : $ 0 and that means that overall , more people die . So we 've agreed that we want to socialize the internet . That 's fine , we just need to acknowledge that . Without net neutrality , the average internet speed of everyone would be strictly higher , but some services and people would suffer unfairly . The most offensive thing to me is how Zuckerberg tries to paint this as altruistic . If this is done , I think that arguably it is good for the people of India ( at least if they 're made aware that Facebook is not the entire internet ! ) . They go from no internet to some internet : they end up with strictly more internet . Capitalism can be good for people ! And saying , oh , Facebook 's only doing this for their own interests would be dumb , because that 's the point , that 's why they 're incentivized to do it , that 's how capitalism works , saying that is as stupid as saying oh my sponsors are evil , they only want to sponsor me so more people will buy their stuff ..

1031,28931,Why are pay bonuses taxed heavier than your regular wage ? Do you technically get more of that back ? Is more of bonus money put towards retirement income ? Please explain like I'm five.,"Income is generally taxed more as you earn more . For example , the first $ 15,000 might have no tax , $ 15 - 40,000 might be at 10 % , and above $ 40,000 might be at 20 % . These are called tax brackets . Generally at the start of the year , your employer figures out your average tax and keeps that to give to the government directly . For example if you earn $ 30,000 you 'd owe 5 % on average , so you 'd only get to take home $ 28,500 . If you get a bonus , it could take you into a higher tax bracket , but even if it does n't you 'll still have to pay the full amount of tax for the top tax bracket , rather than the average . In my example , if you get a $ 10,000 bonus , you 'd own 10 % of that in tax , so you 'd only get to take home $ 9,000 . The end result is that you 're still paying the same amount of tax as if you had been earned $ 40,000 , but the tax is n't as nicely averaged over the entire year .",Fake,Real,0.9915163516998292,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

1043,29283,"Is there a finite amount of water on Earth ? Basically , does water getting evaporated up , precipitated down , frozen or melted remain the same through the different cycles . Please explain like I'm five.","Your question is a little unclear to me -- does water remain the same as it changes states through various cycles ? Do you mean does the amount of water stay the same ? Or do you mean does the water itself somehow change at a more fundamental level ? I 'll try and answer both since it 's interesting to think about . We all are familiar with water 's different forms : ice , liquid , steam and are taught that they are all "" water "" . But if we 're going to try and measure all the water on the earth we should probably ask ourselves how do we know that something is actually water ? After all , if you grew up in a hot climate and then later in life got on a ship and sailed somewhere and saw an iceberg for the first time you would probably not realise that it was made of the same stuff as the ocean . Also , the gasoline that powers cars [ appears similar to liquid water ] ( URL_1 ) but it 's also obviously not the same , it can catch fire while water can not . So what 's the difference ? You need to understand that water is really a collection of zillions of unbelievably small components ( molecules ) that are all exactly the same . We call a substance water when it is built from these particular molecules . It is the interactions between these identical molecules that determine water 's form -- whether something is liquid , ice , or steam . Back to your question . The total amount of water in , on , and around our planet has been roughly the same , at least over recent history ( say since the beginning of civilisation ) . From your question you clearly know that at any moment some of the water on the planet is changing form , most of these processes happen because of energy from sunlight , but geology also plays a role . Since these processes are always occuring the amount of water in these various forms does change over time , but the total amount stays the same . E.g. water that escapes from the melting of sea ice obviously just becomes water floating in the ocean . This is the principle of the [ water cycle ] ( URL_3 ) which I think you already know about but I am leading to a point . Water can move into places where it becomes locked away and stops moving through the active part water cycle for a very long time . For example it can filter into the ground and stay there for [ billions of years ] ( URL_4 ) . In this way you might be able to argue that the amount of water does n't really stay the same since that water is inaccessible . That 's all still probably pretty unsurprising . There are however some more interesting forms that water can take and transformations that can occur . When it goes underground , instead of just floating around in gaps between the rocks geologic processes can make it so that the water actually becomes part of the rock itself . Water and [ hematite ] ( URL_2 ) can be combined to form [ goethite ] ( URL_5 ) . The water becomes locked away within the structure of the crystal itself , forming a "" hydrate "" . In a totally different process , plants also transform water into something unrecognisable . Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen , H2O right ? In photosynthesis , a very sophisticated process , plants harness the energy of sunlight and use it to crack water molecules apart into their components . They discard the oxygen as waste but combine the hydrogen with carbon dioxide from the air to form sugars . These sugars are used in various ways , they may be eaten by the plant later for energy or they can be combined further to make molecules that eventually become structural components like wood . At this point things start to get a bit grey : the plant took a water molecule but broke it apart , it even threw away the oxygen , so by the earlier definition its not really water anymore is it ? And yet , the substances that a plant makes with photosynthesis are called "" carbo*hydrates * "" . This implies that they contain water , like the mineral was a hydrate . In fact the plant only threw away the oxygen because the other ingredient in carbohydrates , carbon dioxide , also contains oxygen so there was a surplus . All oxygen atoms are exactly the same so it does n't really matter where they come from . Scientists can also use electricity to break water apart , this is called [ electrolysis ] ( URL_0 ) . It produces hydrogen gas and oxygen gas as you might expect . Again , water has ceased to be water . So are n't we going to eventually run out of water if it disappears into minerals , wood , and gas ? Well , one reason water is so common is because it 's actually a very stable molecule . It takes lots of energy to break water molecules apart , so these are really quite unusual examples that I gave where outside energy was harnessed ( from the sun , from a battery ) and applied in a directed way . The things that are produced , like wood or oxygen and hydrogen gases actually contain a lot of stored energy . If this stored energy is unleashed with a match a chain reaction of combustion will occur and the processes that created them will be undone . What 's left at the end ? Water .",Fake,Real,0.9475929141044616,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Jewelry professionals use a systematic way to evaluate and discuss these factors . Otherwise , there would be no way to compare one diamond to another . And there would be no way to evaluate and discuss the qualities of an individual diamond . Diamond professionals use the grading system developed by GIA in the 1950s , which established the use of four important factors to describe and classify diamonds : Clarity , Color , Cut , and Carat Weight .

1061,30075,"Why Does 24fps Have a Movie - Feel While 60fps Looks Like a Soap Opera ? What 's the science behind that "" filmic "" look that 24fps produces ? It 's a subtle yet indescribable difference to me . Please explain like I'm five.","If you are in North America , it 's probably due to the 3:2 Pull down . Movies have traditionally been shot in 24fps , though it is changing now . However , your television ca n't show 24fps , it either shows 25 or 30fps , depending on which region you are in . If you 're in region 2 ( E.g. Europe ) they will simply play the clip at 25fps , so it will in practice be played slightly faster . That 's why when you look at movie playing times , they differ between regions . US is region 1 . Displaying 24fps on a 30fps display is a bit more tricky . Legacy standards define a movie picture as two ' fields ' . Each field contains every second line in the picture . Your old television therefore show Top Field 1 , Bottom Field 1 , Top Field 2 , Bottom Field 2 , etc . This is a cathode ray speed thing but we 're still stuck with it . When we display 24fps material in 30Hz , we insert extra fields , so the order is like this : TF1 , BF1 , TF2 , BF2 , TF2 , BF3 , TF3 , BF4 , TF4 , BF4 . You can see how two of the fields are repeated . As they are merged together by your television , you do n't see this , but it means that every second frame has a display time of 33.3ms , every other frame has a display time of 50ms . This can cause especially horizontal motion to sometimes look a bit jumpy to the trained eye .

This is by far the most common time signature . 5/4 will feel like a 2/4 followed by a 3/4 ( or vice versa ) , but this is getting into the realm of esoteric contemporary music . They can usually tell if this is the case if the tempo keeps switching between 2/4 and 3/4 in a regular fashion . 6/8 will sound like 2/4 with 3/4 stuck inside each beat ; 3/4 with 2/4 stuck inside each beat will usually be 6/4 .

I hang out in a lot of tech subreddits , just out of interest and I 'm starting to see a lot of support for Vulkan and it replacing DX Please explain like I'm five.","Taking this a different direction . Sorry if this dips out of ELI5 but I do n't go too technical . DirectX is a way to talk to your graphics card from the Windows operating system . OpenGL is a way to talk to your graphics card from any operating system . Vulkan is the successor to OpenGL ( also I 'm excited ) . DirectX is maintained by Microsoft , Nvidia , and AMD . It is first party to the Microsoft ecosystem , has a very tight governance , and is built by people who need it to work for Xbox as well as your PC . Because of this , DirectX has been more agile than OpenGL for a while . Old DirectX was basically a copy of OpenGL , but as Microsoft got smarter and more invested , it added in new features that started to make OpenGL less capable for real time rendering - like games . This is because Microsoft was really focused on two markets : PC games and Xbox games . DirectX 10 , 11 and 12 has involved an impressive and gradual architectural change to better enable multi - threaded hardware and more advanced modern features like tesselation . OpenGL is maintained by the Khronos group , which is governed much more openly by Microsoft , Nvidia , AMD , Google , Epic , Huawei , Samsung , Qualcomm , ARM , and a very long list of others . It has a very open governance and was originally built and maintained by rendering companies focusing on correctness with real time performance as a secondary concern . In addition to that the open governance makes it harder to have a unified direction , as well as agility : because OpenGL is used across more platforms and architectures , and in more scenarios , it is harder to get changes pushed through . In addition , because it is n't first party it is sometimes less performant . Vulkan is the successor to OpenGL and allows Khronos to make breaking changes in architecture . Ideally this will allow for the best of both worlds : the modern capabilities of DirectX , along with the multi - platform nature of OpenGL . It is a challenger to DirectX 's power and capabilities . Since it has the mobile market by virtue of Android , it will hopefully see uptake in the PC and console environments . Couple notes : 1 . DirectX is sort of tied to your version of the OS . XP users are capped out at DirectX 9.0c , which is the last of the older architecture . DirectX 10 died with Vista , but DirectX 11 and 12 should be able to work on 7 - 10 . I have n't tried 12 on 7 yet . 2 . I purposefully left out some of the bigger discussion points around OpenGL vs. DirectX , because I have n't been in that space for two years .",Fake,Real,0.9050748348236084,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

1092,31195,"Physically in the brain , what is the difference between a regular dream and a lucid dream ? What is actually happening ? Optional ELI5 : How do people lucid dream ? Please explain like I'm five.","Okay , not really sure about the first part ( sorry ) , though i have read some theories that lucid dreaming has a connection to higher activity in the front parts of your brain which are where our "" consciousness "" comes from . Other parts of the brain do things like process sound and sight and maintain our balance and body temperature , it 's the front of the brain where we do our thinking . So when the front of the brain becomes active in a dream we are capable of moving from simply observing our dreams to making decisions and choosing how we want our dreams to unfold . As another answer has pointed out , lucid dreaming only refers to being aware during your dream , but many people will chose at that point to try to take control of their dream . This has been confirmed in countless experiments , and if you so choose , you can probably start practicing today and have a lucid dream within about two weeks time ( frequency increases with further practice , some people claim to have them nearly every night ) . But how do you practice ? There are several techniques , such as FILD , DILD , and MILD . I 'll leave you to google some of those terms , they 're all well discusses techniques and you can find a wealth of information about how they work and how to practice them . But they tend to focus on two elements . Maintaining consciousness as you move into dreaming , or regaining consciousness mid dream . I 'm personally skeptical of attempts to maintain consciousness because there can be hours between falling asleep and starting to dream , during which you are n't conscious anyway . However people claim to have success with these techniques . It generally consists of counting , repeating a mantra , or doing some activity like constantly moving your fingers just a little bit . The idea being that you will get tired and fall asleep but this little bit of activity will keep your conscious brain awake . I have personally had success with the other type of technique , where you attempt to train yourself to recognize dreams . This can be by identifying common elements of your dreams and checking for signs of dreaming whenever you see these elements ( is there often an angry donkey , in your dreams ? Every time you see an angry donkey , check if you 're dreaming ) , this can be hard if your dream markers are things that do n't happen in real life much . Another approach is to try to be constantly aware of small details . Dreams tend to be light on fine details , like the texture of tiles , or the shadows of trees . so if you get a habit of noticing these things , it can transfer to your dream , and you 'll be likely to notice that the details are off . My personal approach is to develop a habit of regularly performing reality checks even if i think it likely that i 'm not currently dreaming . Again , i 'm hoping for this habit to transfer to a dream , and then i 'll do the check and realize that i am dreaming . You can google for a list of check you can perform , but i 'll list some of my personal favorites . Push a finger through your hand , dreams are malleable and it 's possible to do all kinds of unreal things , so try pushing your ginger through the opposite palm , in a dream this can work . Look at text , look away , look at it again . Often text will change rapidly in dreams , it 's one of those details that the brain skimps on when drawing the dream . Look at a clock , they often run backwards , and digital clocks with just flicker through numbers rapidly instead of displaying a proper time . If you often wear a watch , this one is nice because you will probably have a watch in your dream too , which gives you something to use for your reality check . It may be worth doing a few of these check because i have failed the hand check during a dream because i did n't believe properly that it would work . That 's the funny thing about lucid dreams , you MAY be able to control everything , but only if you believe it well enough . If you are convinced that you ca n't fly , then you 're actually biasing the dream to be a dream in which you ca n't fly .

1107,31575,Job assessment tests with incongruent answers [ example in text body ] This makes my head asplode : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"These are typically questions used to understand the characteristic profile of a candidate , and figure if they would fit in a particular team or role or culture . There may not always be one right answer in these questions . For example , your employer may be looking for a person who just diligently does what he / she is told rather than take initiative . So you ca n't assume taking initiative is a good thing . You should understand what type of people they are looking for , determine how desperate you are for that job , and plan your answers accordingly . Now for some analysis . Note that this is from my perspective . The perspective of the interviewer may be totally different . Q1 : People often do not know if they should choose left option . So right option might have been given as an easy way out . The right one has less bearing on your job than the left one . The correct answer again depends on the job profile . If the company culture values cooperation between employees more than individual performance , then left may be correct answer . Q2 : This question can be used to differentiate between the timid and risk takers . Again , depending on the company culture one quality may be more preferred than the other . The left answer may sometimes be used to weed out over - ambitious people . Q3 : Left is a positive answer , and right is a neutral answer . Note the word * usually * which is a conditional . This makes this answer a weak one ( similar to the words * not always * in first question ) . Q4 : Not willing to take small risks can be problematic in most corporate cultures . People often learn by making mistakes . If you avoid tasks because you might make mistakes , then you may not be suitable for most jobs . Compared to that , being perceived as disorganized is not that big a problem . Best way to go in such questions is to be truthful and go with your gut feeling . You may not want to end up in a job that is against your nature . ( Source : Self . Conducted hundreds of hiring interviews over the years .

1110,31671,What exactly is a strawman argument ? The wikipedia article just confused me more and it 's really bugging me . Please explain like I'm five.,"You seem to have a pretty decent understanding , now , but I 'd like to warn you ... Watch out for thinking someone is using a strawman argument when they are n't . For instance , to use an example found elsewhere in this thread , if you were arguing for the legalization of marijuana , and a person responded with "" you want potheads to drive while high ? That 's a terrible idea "" , that would be a strawman . However , if they asked "" what about driving ? It seems like driving while high would be dangerous "" . That 's not a strawman , that 's a question . They are n't claiming that your position is to allow such a thing , they are proposing something they think might confound your position , which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do . If in the course of making your argument for legal marijuana , you said "" I do n't think the government has any business regulating what a person puts into their own body "" , and the person you 're discussing with shifts from talking about marijuana , to talking about bath salts and pcp ( despite you not bringing up those drugs ) , they are not making a strawman argument . You made an argument with broader implications than just marijuana , and it is justified for them to follow such arguments to their conclusion , even if you do n't agree with that conclusion . By showing you that your logic results in absurd conclusions , a person is n't committing a strawman , because they are n't saying that you hold those conclusions . They are saying that your logic supports such conclusions , and as such it must be wrong . As a different example ... if someone argued that the death penalty is justified because it prevents a crime from happening again , I could very well say "" well , by that logic , you could say ' death to jaywalkers ! ' - it prevents the crime from happening again , right ? "" . Note that I am not distorting their position - I 'm not claiming that they are saying we should execute jaywalkers - I 'm trying to say that their argument is n't sufficient . Given , in that example I 'm going about it in a stupid way , admittedly , but it 's not a strawman . edit : It 's also possible for someone to misunderstand your position . Do n't assume the worst of someone by thinking they are deliberately trying to misrepresent your position when in reality they might just be confused about what you are actually proposing .",Fake,Real,0.9376193881034852,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Similarly , to build up immunity to the venom or poison , you would expose yourself to a non - lethal dosage of the said venom or poison , * not * the antidote , so your body builds up inherent resistance in the mechanisms on which the venom / poison operates rather than creating a dependency on the antidote .

This will be more about speakers in general , not just headphones . - the membranes have a significant weight compared to the air they move and are suspended by a spring . This means that they ca n't oscillate freely , they are a spring / mass system with a resonance frequency and very complicated response to the force applied by the motor .

This describes the energy that is needed to create a magnetic field in a coil , an effect that increases the resistance ( called impendance in this case ) the higher the frequency of the signal is , causing a decrease in volume at high frequencies . This is a huge problem for fullrange ( just one type of chassis produces all frequencies ) speakers like headphones , making it very difficult to produce both very low and very high frequencies - if the membrane has access to air on both sides the low pressure on one side and high pressure on the other will increasingly cancel each other out at low frequencies , making it neccessary to seperate the two "" volumes "" . This is not a big problem for in ear headphones , but causes some of the biggest headaches when designing low frequency speakers - an enclosure on the rear of the membrane creates another problem : It acts like a spring that has to be taken into account and can cause noise through standing waves ( sound waves that bounce back and forth between two or more walls , increasing in amplitude like a swing ) - the enclosure and especially the membrane can start swinging in itself , like a drumhead struck by a stick . Fortunately an excellent membrane material with good dampening is quite cheap , cardboard , but the more compact a speaker gets the more strain is put on its enclosure and membrane increasing this noise . This is why many high end speakers and headphones use expensive membrane materials like titanium , certain ceramics or kevlar - regardless of how well designed a chassis ( the actual "" speaker "" part of a speaker ) is , it will never have an even frequency response , influenced by the design choices . This means that there may an increase or decrease over the average in volume at certain frequencies .

1299,35983,How can a standardized test be biased toward a race or different minority group ? I 've heard claims that certain standardized tests like the SAT or firefighter 's exam are biased ( especially toward racial minorities ) . How can an aptitude test show bias ? Explain like I'm five.,"There is also a method of determining how much a group 's poor performance on a test is due to bias vs actual inability . The way it works is the following . You come up with several different questions : 1 . cuarenta y tres más siete 2 . ciento seis mas veintinueve 3 . un mil seiscientos cuatro más Quinientos ocho ( In English , the questions are 43 + 7 , 20 + 106 and 1604 + 508 . ) Those who do n't speak Spanish will fail all 3 questions . That 's bias . The trick here is that people who are bad at math but good at Spanish will answer 1 but fail 3 . So now you look at how different populations do on the test : Say out of 1000 Mexicans who took the test , 1000 get question 1 and 500 get question 3 . Out of 1000 Americans , 300 answer question 1 and 150 answer question 3 . You can conclude that both groups are probably equally good at math since 500/1000 = = 150/300 , and the test is simply biased .

1401,38534,"Why do I find male comedians consistently funnier than female comedians , is there a reason behind this ? Apologies to anyone who finds this sexist , it 's not intended to be and I am just inquisitive as to whether there is an explanation behind this . Explain like I'm five.","Because that 's what the culture wherein media exists is constantly reinforcing . It 's the same reason there are n't very many female CEOs or very many ' great women painters . ' Not too long ago , all of these areas of life were entirely male - dominated ; for centuries . That 's a long time to entrench ideas about what things should look like and sound like and act like in order to be worthwhile . Nowadays , as more and more women enter these spheres of life , it seems weird to those who are entrenched in the male - dominated culture of said sphere . There are n't very many of them ( women ) doing this ... they must not be very good at whatever it is , or not like it very much , otherwise there would be more , right ? Maybe the reason women are less likely to participate in a certain sphere of life is because they are constantly being told they do n't belong in that sphere ! Tina Fey wrote in her book Bossypants about how when she was starting out she worked in an improv troupe , and when they were considering changing from a cast of 2 women and 4 men to 3 women and 3 men , her boss plaintively said ' no one wants to see a show with just women ' or something along those lines . She was stunned , but unsurprised . Just as I am to see this thread and this topic of discussion brought up again and again , in all areas of life . It 's the same old tune . Women care about and can be interested in everybody , while men only care about other men . I think that 's bullshit , and really insulting to men . This is the reason "" womens "" issues are supposedly special interest . Mens issues are called the news . Do n't kid yourselves , it 's not their high - pitched voices , or the fact that they only ever joke about relationships and vaginas , or the fact that they have to be hot enough to fuck in order for them to hold mens interest long enough to crack a joke . It 's the same - old boys club holdover that begs these questions about women 's competence in every other area of societal life . Few * * people * * could face such an obvious uphill slog to get to participate in an area of life they enjoy without risking the bullshit dampening any desire they have to do what they love , not just women . I wish we could do an experiment and see how many male comedians made it to a place of moderate fame if they had their ability to be funny questioned at every juncture . What if Louis C.K. or Jim Gaffigan or Kevin Hart or George Carlin had been asked why they thought men just were n't that funny in every other interview ? What if they had to constantly defend their right to even be on stage ? What if they had throngs of people discussing whether they thought men were evolutionarily able to be funny ?

1601,42930,Why is it that women tend to have gay men in their social cirles while it 's unusual for men to have lesbians in theirs ? Sorry if it 's phrased weirdly but it 's 1 am . Explain like I'm five.,"I do n't agree with the reasoning that all men are sexually aggressive towards women or only interested in lesbians if they 're making out ( top two responses at the time I am posting ) . These are broad statements and untrue for many people . A lot of it is cultural and linked to shared interests . Not to stereotype here , but there are many aspects of your traditional gay male subculture that align perfectly with activities typical of women . When we talk about activities such as shopping , fashion , dancing and of course , talking about interest in other men , we think of gay men and women being the predominant participants . Shared interests = friendship in many cases . These are also activities that are very female dominated in terms of interest and viewership . As a straight male , I would probably have mostly female friends if I shared interests in activities that had mostly women in them . My sexual orientation is n't a factor here . This analogy does not translate directly to men and lesbians for several reasons . Let 's talk about sports ; the few lesbians I personally know would much rather cheer for a women 's sports team instead of the male counterpart . In almost all sports , there is a clear division of gender . When 's the last time you heard of a man talking about the latest WNBA game ? One of my lesbian friends dresses very feminine and is very into fashion , and guess what ? Most of her friends are women ! Furthermore , I have noticed that there is "" anti - men "" trend with some lesbians and with some women in general . This trend is nonexistent with the gay male subculture . On the topic of men being sexually aggressive towards lesbians or not being interested in a woman they can not sleep with ... While I stated above that this is a broad , stereotypical statement , there are certainly some men who fall into the category . I think some of this can be tied into how our movies , tv shows , pop culture , etc . tends to portray gay men as friendly , flamboyant , and cheerful . When you talk about lesbians , the first thing most people think of is porn . There is certainly an unequal and unfair portrayal in media and that plays a role in how men and women behave . Once again , not trying to stereotype unfairly or pretend that I am an expert on the subject matter . Some of the top answers are a bit narrow minded , so I wanted to contribute an answer that examined more potential causes from a variety of sources .",Fake,Real,0.995203137397766,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Explain like I'm five.","I think in general it 's the different purposes they are used for . For instance , while ships use a lot of ( extremely cheap , low grade ) fuel , they also transport huge amounts of goods long distances extremely efficiently . The amount of pollution a large , modern ship generates per kg per km is far , far lower than that of a car or a lorry ( which are generally the worst offenders ) . Therefore , people offset the amount of cargo transported against the fuel used . URL_2 As mentioned above , larger ships also tend to use residual fuels ( what 's left over after most other useful things have been distilled from crude ) . This "" heavy fuel oil "" is generally thick , viscous gunk which has to be heated to 180 degrees before it 'll be burn . Therefore nobody really cares that this stuff is being used , beyond the pollution it causes . ( Source - I am a marine engineer ) What is worse than the amount they use however , is the other shit that is in it that ends up in the atmosphere - CO2 , CO , SO2 NOx etc all of which are harmful . The reason nobody gives a shit about this is that all that crap gets spewed out in the middle of the ocean where nobody is around to see it .

Once upon a time , being in a fraternity really meant something , but now i am convinced that they exist solely as a business that sells no products . Let me explain When you join a fraternity , you are forced to remember and live by a certain set a guidelines . Typically these are related to bettering one 's self , helping the community , fostering a sense of brotherhood , blah blah blah . Most of them are completely interchangeable and largely ignored once the a member moves from becoming a pledge , to a full fledged brother . At this point most brothers do n't care about the doctrines other than feeling pride that they can remember them all verbatim , and forcing new members to remember and recite them as was done to them when they themselves were new members . As a brother , you are responsible to pay local dues / fees , and national dues / fees , among other fees that cover things like insurance that absolves the national headquarters of liability should you hurt yourself doing some stupid frat boy shit . The local dues go into an account that funds things like your frat boy parties , and your frat boy trips , and if applicable , the rent to live in the frat house . The national dues go to the national headquarters to pay the salaries of the people who work there . They put out news bulletins that no one cares about , and are largely responsible for growing the fraternity .

You will have a rather low chance of finding one . Nothing surprising here , there are approximately 365 days in a year and 69 persons can at most only cover 19 % of the year . Now , what is paradoxical is that , if you try again , and again , and again , with every person in the room , there is a big chance that one of them have the same birthday as an other one ! * Lets do the maths :* In the first case , the probability that nobody in the remaining 69 has the same birthday as the first one is ( 364/365)^69 ~= 82.8 % . So , there is approximately 17.2 % chance of collision with that person . As expected . Lets assume there was no collision with the first , so you pick the second one and compare to the 68 remaining ones ( no need to compare to the first , you know there is no collision with her ) . The probability to find a collision , now , is a little bit smaller ( there is less people remaining ) , it 's 1-(364/365)^68 ~= 17.0 % chance . Lets combine the two first persons : * either there is a collision with the first : 17.2 % * either there is no collision with the first , but a collision with the second : 82.8 % * 17.0 % ~= 14 % The sum of those two possibilities is now : 31,2 % ! i.e. : There is 31,2 % chance to have at least a collision within the first two person you choose .

1784,46564,"In quantum physics , why do particles react differently when being observed ? Thanks guys ! This is all really interesting stuff . Explain like I'm five.","* * Easy Answer :* * To see a particle , it has to affect your detector . In the big world ( macroscopic ) , when we talk about objects , we 're looking at the average of a * massive * amount of particles , so if we bump everything a tiny amount , it does n't change much . With a quantum particle , we 've just got one tiny particle . It 's * really * hard for that to make a noticeable effect on a big ( macroscopic ) system like your detector . So we have to interact very strongly with it , which changes its state a lot . * * Real Answer :* * The state of a particle can be defined by position and momentum . If you know the environment , and you know an object 's position and momentum , you can tell what 's going to happen to it . Quantum particles do n't have a definite position or momentum . They have a bunch of possible positions and a bunch of possible momentums . We can play with them to restrict the range of possible positions , but this increases the range of possible momentums . We can restrict the possible momentums , but this increases the possible positions . When we "" measure "" a particle , what we 're really doing is sticking it into a very comfortable position ( or momentum ) where it 's not likely to go to any others . Then we can check a bunch of times and be sure that 's where it is . ( Remember , it 's hard to get a tiny quantum particle to affect our big detector , so we have to do it a few times . ) Putting the particle in a comfortable state is known as "" collapsing the wave function "" . That is , by interacting with our measurement apparatus , we 're automatically changing the possible positions / momentums of this particle . This is n't an extra step that we do to make our measurement repeatable , it 's what happens when you hit the thing without being gentle . What if we 're gentle ? Well , if we 're really , really gentle , then our measurement apparatus wo n't interact very strongly with the particle ! We 'll push it a little bit towards a comfortable state , and we 'll get a little bit of information back . We wo n't get a full measurement , since we only glanced at it . Repeating this a big number of times is equivalent to smacking it very hard to begin with . This all hinges on the fact that the particle has n't made up its mind about its position or momentum ( and in fact never does , it just gets very , very limited in its options right when we 're measuring it ) , and does n't actually have a single position or momentum . That 's a pretty big assumption , but a really clever guy named John Stewart Bell came up with a way to check if that was actually the case , and it looks like it 's true .

Please explain like I'm five.","I will explain the waste treatment plant I am currently working at as best I can . After you flush your toilet the sanitary line in your home leads to an interceptor . That 's just a large pipe that collects the feed from other sanitary lines and brings it to the treatment plant . Depending on how far away you are from the plant you could see pretreatment in the interceptor . This could include bleaching and or debris removal witch a bar screen . There is also almost always a need for lift stations in the interceptors . Gravity being the easiest way to move the waste eventually the pipe gets so deep it has to be pumped to a hire spot and then allowed to flow by gravity to the plant again . At the plant ! Pre - treatment There are two types of pre treat at my plant . Bar screens and grit cyclones . A bar screen is a horizontal conveyor with holes in it . This allows water to flow through but not large debris . We see daily condoms , tampons , rubber bands , and dental floss in the bar screen . None of those should be flushed . As the bar screen pulls the debris out of the water it drops it into an auger that squeezes a lot of the moisture out and drops into a dumpster . Grit cyclones . These are tanks with a mixed in the top . The cyclone actions allows the heaviest materials to be pushed to the bottom and lighter material and water to go out . The heaviest material being sand rocks dirt and corn all go through a different auger and are thrown in a dumpster . Primary treatment- this is where the waste gets separated for further treatment . Primary clarifies are the first stop . They are large tanks that do two things . They let grease and other scum rise to the top to be cleaned off . They also let heavy biological material(poop ) sink to the bottom . The poop is sucked off the bottom with a pump . Thickening tanks . Thickening tanks work the exact same way as primary clarifies . They are only working with the poop dense water that was sucked off the bottom of the primary clarifies . This allows much greater settling . In both of this tanks there is always water added so some water gets pushed over the top and runs in troughs to the next tank . The poop on the bottom of thickeners is sent to digesters . Secondary treatment I will focus on what happens with the now clearer water first then go back to the thickened poop . The water now has most of the really heavy stuff out if it but there are still tiny bugs parasites and pathogens left in the water . The purpose of secondary treatment is making an environment for "" bugs "" to eat what 's left in the water . Anaerobic In the anaerobic tanks no air is supplied this starves the bugs present in the water and makes them very hungry . It also allows them to mix with the new water being added . Aerobic This is where most of the actual water treatment takes place . The mixture of bugs and water now gets the perfect amount of air . This makes the starved bugs very hungry and they begin eating up all the light stuff still floating in the water . There are also mixers in the tanks so everything stays perfectly together . Everything then flows to final tanks . Final tanks . Like our primary tanks these are for settling . What settles is the now full and fat bugs that were eating the light poop and other harmful materials . When they are sucked off the bottom some go to the digesters some go back to the anaerobic so we keep good healthy bugs doing work . The water that goes out now very clear has one last stop at disinfection . Disinfection breaks down what 's left of the bad material in the water . Disinfection is done with high intensity UV bulbs that harm the pathogens in the water making them unable to reproduce and ok for the environment . The water is now clean and pumped to a river Now we have to back track and see what 's going in with the heavy waste that settled . It has all been thickened by settling and lumped to digesters . Digesters- used to breakdown the heavy bad material found in the waste . These are huge closed top tanks that are heated to 98.6 degrees . They act like a human stomach . Heating and using natural occurs acids to break down the waste and kill anything inside of it . What comes out is a black soupy liquid that is essential fertilizer because some good stuff is left like nitrogen . Belt filter press -this is used to remove water from the soupy liquid A substances is added that helps bind everything together and then it goes through a series of rollers .

Please explain like I'm five.","I was in a fraternity for two years in college . Once upon a time , being in a fraternity really meant something , but now i am convinced that they exist solely as a business that sells no products . Let me explain When you join a fraternity , you are forced to remember and live by a certain set a guidelines . Typically these are related to bettering one 's self , helping the community , fostering a sense of brotherhood , blah blah blah . Most of them are completely interchangeable and largely ignored once the a member moves from becoming a pledge , to a full fledged brother . At this point most brothers do n't care about the doctrines other than feeling pride that they can remember them all verbatim , and forcing new members to remember and recite them as was done to them when they themselves were new members . As a brother , you are responsible to pay local dues / fees , and national dues / fees , among other fees that cover things like insurance that absolves the national headquarters of liability should you hurt yourself doing some stupid frat boy shit . The local dues go into an account that funds things like your frat boy parties , and your frat boy trips , and if applicable , the rent to live in the frat house . The national dues go to the national headquarters to pay the salaries of the people who work there . They put out news bulletins that no one cares about , and are largely responsible for growing the fraternity . So .... pay national to be a brother ... they use that money to get more brothers ... so they have have to pay money . National gets paid .. and the brother gets ... well .... he buys friends . I think the whole thing is bullshit and a waste of money . If you are an "" Officer "" in the fraternity , you get to put in hours of your time with no reward except a nugget on your resume which really means jack shit unless you 're the president of the fraternity , and even then , it does n't mean much .

1917,49132,"Is there ever an advantage for an average person to lease a new car vs buying it ? The care dealerships always seem to push leasing , so I would assume they make more money that way . is this true ? Please explain like I'm five.","IIT there seems to be an awful lot of assumptions and "" that sounds right "" logic , but no insider knowledge . I used to agree that there leasing was basically for suckers who wanted to own a car beyond their means , but my brother ( who works in a dealership ) convinced me otherwise . Like everything , there is a tradeoff but according to him , leasing is actually kind of win win for both parties . Buying : When you buy a car , it is yours and you do whatever you want with it . Personally , this is a big plus , but financially , maybe not the wisest move . You see , your car loses value as soon as it goes from new to used so one month in , you owe most of the car which has lost a substantial amount of value . With homes , people tend to sell them ( and panic ) but for some reason , they do n't think about it with cars . Leasing : This benefits the dealership because , like some assumed , they still own the car at the end of the day . However , they own a 2 - 5 yr old car which is worth a whole lot less than when you first started using it . The reason dealerships will take this deal anyways is because there is a definite market for used cars and a need to have a used car inventory . Leasing often ties you to the dealership for maintenance , so they have definite records of how good the car is ( important for warranties etc ) . Believe it or not , this actually benefits the consumer many times too . Whether we realize it or not , people who tend to buy a new car , also tend to want an even newer car 5 - 7 years down the road . If they bought , they paid a lot more than a lease , for a car that is worth way less now . For people who buy a car until it breaks down , the old car often further drains you with maintenance after the 100k mark where more expensive parts need to be purchased and cars tend to become unreliable . Things to know : Older cars become less valuable , and more so at high mileage points . For this reason , the dealership puts strict rules and steep fees for driving more than the allotted miles . If you have no choice and KNOW you will use more than the miles provided , my brother recommends you BUY and not lease . However , he does suggest you buy a certified used car as the economic drop of a car going from new to used is simply not worth it . This is obviously , his advice to me as his brother , but often tells this to customers too . However , intangibles like piece of mind do n't have a set value , and many customers decide to buy new anyways . Deals : Some people ITT mentioned about deals . The profit margin for a new car ( lease or sold ) is actually quite small so saying "" give me your best price "" is nt going to work . For this reason , you will rarely find an amazing deal from dealership to dealership as they are all buying from the same company . Essentially , a 2015 Honda Accord will be the same base price in any Honda dealership . The biggest difference is in financing which can vary depending on how big of a risk a dealership wants to take on your creditworthiness ( and this is actually what you probably want to focus on if getting a new car ) . Deals do exist with used cars though . For some reason , many dealerships will sell a used car for a loss if they have had it for too long . It is pretty much just taking up space . Trade ins : We did n't discuss this ( my brother and I ) , but generally , you will get less than your car is worth for a trade in . However , it is usually likely they will take it , so some people are okay with eating the loss . He always sells his own cars to private parties . Loyalty : With this 5 - 7 year new car trend , dealerships rely A LOT on return customers and referrals . While of course , the dealership wants to make as much money as possible , they would also rather sell you two cars than one . For this reason , dealerships generally play it safe across the board and would rather make their money with add ons than with totally ripping you off on the base price of a new car .

2057,52120,"What do famous artists do when they 're on stage giving a concert and have to sneeze , cough , yawn etc . Its really all in the title Please explain like I'm five.","Artists and performers on stage are usually very focused on what they do for their audience . Because they give all their attention to the part they are playing , they tend to forget their other , bodily needs . They are also very well prepared ; when something goes wrong , like a light blinking when it 's not supposed to , someone heckling , a sound problem , etc , they often rely on their training ( the rehearsal ) so that they do n't panic and can stay focused . I mention training because it helps focus , but also because part of it is voice training : singin puts a lot of strain on the throat , and you have to be very well prepared before a concert , and take good care of your voice . Some artists ( or their managers ) will cancel a show if they have even a suspicion that they may have a cold . Usually their throats and lungs are healthy and trained , so they do n't need to cough . Another reason why you do n't see them cough or sneeze is because the shows are usually made to look like performers are not at the same level as the audience , like they move and sing in a different world : that 's because we go to concerts to see something spectacular , not something ordinary . In some cultures , people wear masks , in others lots of make - up ; almost everywhere , the stage is a space where the audience does n't go . When a performers sneezes , it breaks the magic , because they become a normal human again . That 's why we 're shocked when Janet Jackson shows a nipple or Beyonce makes a silly face on stage - not because nipples or silly faces are bad , but because , as performers , they 're expected to have a different sort of presence , and be always like dolls or costumed people or not - really - humans when on the stage . But in some cultures it 's different . Some music scenes have people improvizing more . Some concerts have burps in the middle of a song and still it 's okay . Some singers forget lyrics and everyone laughs . Some musicians do things like cough and sneeze and vomit on the stage - that 's because in some cultures , sub - cultures , genres , performers are expected to be very much humans .",Fake,Real,0.9522145986557008,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

2061,52228,"Is it physically possible to bring a dead body back to life ? I 'm not talking about hospital scenarios but say someone dies from like drowning or choking , Why ca n't we revive them ? Also , what 's the point in freezing bodies ? Please explain like I'm five.","Once the brain stops getting oxygen , there 's usually less than 5 minutes to get oxygen going to it again . After that 5 minutes , the cells in the brain die and are dead for good . They 're just very sensitive . So when you choke or drown , you only have the oxygen that was already in your blood to sustain you . You 've got a few minutes . If you die , your heart will stop . That 's death . So there 's a 2 or 3 minute window that CPR can start to pump blood again , and oxygen can be given through rescue breaths . And the new methods used that involve cooling the dead are pretty neat . In some of the newer trials , all blood in the body is being replaced with very cold saline . This slows the metabolism of the body to the point where you have a couple hours to fix whatever injury there was . So let 's say you have a large artery cut in your shoulder , and you 're bleeding out . Well it 'll take too long to repair usually , so you get drained of blood and filled with cold saline . That buys time for the repair . Then you are rewarmed at a "" Medium "" pace . Too slow or too fast is bad . The studies are showing hugely better outcomes . Fun fact : There have been cases of people drowning in cold , clean water . They were under water for over 45 minutes in some cases , and are still revived . That 's the cold saline effect sorta . We have a saying in EMS ; "" They 're not dead until they 're warm and dead . "" So we 'll work ya longer if you 're cold .",Fake,Real,0.9901778101921082,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

However , there are some distinguishing features . In most species , the mouth flaps ( on either side of the beak ) will still be pink , not black like with adults . The young will also likely be emitting a constant , and perhaps annoying , begging call ( for TC 's it 's a high - pitched "" waah , "" waah "" ) . Finally , the young crow may also have differently coloured eyes to its parents . I know that American crows have blue eyes when they 're young & amp;amp ; black when they 're adult .

But something broke , so they ca n't deliver it to you . When it is fixed , they send them all at once . 2 . Maybe something is wrong with your phone .

The question was if this is a result of an incomplete theory , a false interpretation or really the true nature of physics . Schrödinger wanted to point out how ridiculous it would be , if this theory was true and invented his thought experiment of a cat in a box being dead and alive at the same time . Today we know that it is true and QM itself tells us , why we do n't see it in our every day life . If a system is in such a superposition ( dead AND alive ) and you "" measure "" it ( open the box ) , it is forced to choose one of the possibilities ( dead OR alive ) . But even if you do not open the box , there is a chance , that the environment will measure the system by itself . This chance is higher in larger systems ( lot of particles ) than in small ( some particles ) . In very large systems ( cat ) the state ( dead OR alive ) is even measured before every particle can be put in the superposition ( dead AND alive ) . There have been experiments with "" photonic cats "" . One puts a number of photons ( cat ) into an optical cavity ( box ) and sets them into a classically forbidden superposition ( dead AND alive ) .

But the end of the game , right before you switch , the chance your original door is a loser is still 1/3 . * The question and the paradox is why with only two doors left , why is it your chance of still having a losing door is 1/3 , not 1/2 . * * * The answer to the paradox is that when Monty shows you a door , he does not show you a random door , he purposely shows you a door that gives you zero information * * . At the end of the game , nothing has changed . Your chance of winning has not changed . It was 1/3 at the beginning and it is still 1/3 at the end . To explain why that is true , read on . * * Monty Hall Explained * * You know that when you originally pick a door your chance of winning is only 1/3 and that * at least * on of the doors left has a goat . Knowing that , should you give up your door and pick one of the other two doors ? Who knows , maybe yes maybe no ... the chance of any of the 3 doors is the same , 1/3 . The chance your original pick is a car is 1/3 . Now at this point , Monty * purposely * picks a door with a goat . You know there is one like that so you learn nothing from the fact that he showed you one . In fact , he could have you blindfolded and just told you he opened a door . So him opening a door does nothing . The chance your original door is a winner is still 1/3 after he opens a door just like it was before he opened a door . Since the chance your original door is a winner is 1/3 , that means the chance it is a loser is 2/3 . Well , if you have a 2/3 chance of losing with your door , why keep it when there is only one other door left to pick at the end ?

First off the plumbing valve and water valve at the top is gone . The second and most interesting change is the drain at the bottom . The drain valve is what in the plumbing world is called a Trap . It is called this because in a traditional water system it is supposed to hold a small amount of water after the flush to prevent smells and such from escaping the pipes . That is why in traditional systems you always see a little water in the drain , it is also why there is water in a toilet after you flush . In a waterless system the most important part is the drain valve . What you see is a cap with a small gap to let fluids through . This is there to prevent things like cigarettes and chewing gum from getting into the deeper parts of the drain valve and messing things up . The major difference is that the fluid in the trap is no longer flush water , it is now replaced with Oil that is less dense then urine .

2678,67627,Suspended Chords and 7 's for guitar I 'm trying to learn about suspended Chords and my 7th 's but I do n't quite understand how everything works . Explain like I'm five.,"Chords are combinations of two or more notes . With just three notes , we can get a surprising variety of chords . Many chords with different notes in them sound the same - this is because while the notes are different , the relationship between the notes are the same . We classify chords based on this relationship between the notes . A major chord has a very specific distance between each of the notes . Major chords sound happy :) Every major chord shares the same sound quality - that quality of sounding happy and bright . The thing that makes it a major chord is the same thing that gives it that quality . Minor chords have a similar structure to a major chord , but the middle note is lower . This makes the minor chord sound sad :( Even if you think you are not musically inclined , you can probably tell the difference between a major and minor chord after just a few minutes of practice . Our human ears like major chords and minor chords . Another type of chord is a suspended chord ( There are sub - types , like sus2 and sus4 and such ) . Like a major or minor chord , a chord being called "" suspended "" just means it has a very specific relationship between the notes in the chord . They are called suspended because it sounds like one of the notes in the chord is "" suspended "" over where it should be . That note sounds "" higher "" than what your ear wants to hear . Your ear is almost trying to pull that note back down to a different note - the note that would make the chord major , or even minor . A suspended chord provides a kind of tension to your ear . You can pretty much hear where that note "" wants "" to go , and you 're just waiting for it ... waiting for it .... and finally it drops . When the drop happens , we say that the chord "" resolves "" .",Fake,Real,0.9419205784797668,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Strategy games are also seen as a descendant of war games, and define strategy in terms of the context of war, but this is more partial.

3395,72773,"Please explain what is ""Go (game)""","Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.
The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.
The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid. However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game reached Korea in the 5th century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.
Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal Zuo Zhuan[10] (c. 4th century BCE).[11]
Despite its relatively simple rules, Go is extremely complex. Compared to chess, Go has both a larger board with more scope for play and longer games and, on average, many more alternatives to consider per move. The number of legal board positions in Go has been calculated to be approximately 2.1×10170,[12][a] which is vastly greater than the number of atoms in the observable universe, estimated to be of the order of 1080.[14]",Fake,Real,0.5646460652351379,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.
Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.",Fake,Real,0.9671516418457032,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

Fuzzy logic is based on the observation that people make decisions based on imprecise and non-numerical information. Fuzzy models or sets are mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information (hence the term fuzzy). These models have the capability of recognising, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and using data and information that are vague and lack certainty.

3411,73061,"Please explain what is ""Receptive field""","The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms.
Complexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.
A sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body. For example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, and the visual system.
The term receptive field was first used by Sherrington in 1906 to describe the area of skin from which a scratch reflex could be elicited in a dog. In 1938, Hartline started to apply the term to single neurons, this time from the frog retina.
This concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field for a cell in the brain. This process is called convergence.
Receptive fields have been used in modern artificial deep neural networks that work with local operations.",Fake,Real,0.7286165952682495,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.
The test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: ""I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'"" Because ""thinking"" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to ""replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the ""imitation game"", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: ""Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?"" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered. In the remainder of the paper, he argued against all the major objections to the proposition that ""machines can think"".
Since Turing introduced his test, it has been both highly influential and widely criticised, and has become an important concept in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

3417,73196,"Please explain what is ""Training data""","In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.
The model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.
Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).
This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.
Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).

The Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined.
Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph—such as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons.  However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—e.g., as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral.  Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides the necessary abstractions for this.
The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904). It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability.

The same kind of machine learning model can require different constraints, weights or learning rates to generalize different data patterns. These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem.

3436,73451,"Please explain what is ""Vector space""","In mathematics and physics, a vector space (also called a linear space) is a set whose elements, often called vectors, may be added together and multiplied (""scaled"") by numbers called scalars. Scalars are often real numbers, but can be  complex numbers or, more generally, elements of any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. The terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used to specify the nature of the scalars: real coordinate space or complex coordinate space.
Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities, such as forces and velocity, that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrix, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.
Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is finite-dimensional if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.
Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures. This is the case of algebras, which include field extensions, polynomial rings, associative algebras and Lie algebras. This is also the case of topological vector spaces, which include function spaces, inner product spaces, normed spaces, Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.",Fake,Real,0.9998277425765992,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

The first algorithm for random decision forests was created in 1995 by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method, which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the ""stochastic discrimination"" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg.
An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler,[10] who registered[11] ""Random Forests"" as a trademark in 2006 (as of 2019[update], owned by Minitab, Inc.).[12] The extension combines Breiman's ""bagging"" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman[13] in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance.
Random forests are frequently used as ""blackbox"" models in businesses, as they generate reasonable predictions across a wide range of data while requiring little configuration.[citation needed]",Fake,Real,0.9998078942298888,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Probability density  is the  probability per unit length,  in other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.
In a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value. This probability is given by the integral of this variable's PDF over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and the area under the entire curve is equal to 1.
The terms ""probability distribution function"" and ""probability function"" have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function. However, this use is not standard among probabilists and statisticians. In other sources, ""probability distribution function"" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. ""Density function"" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion. In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables.",Real,Fake,0.6579974293708801,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0
3448,73626,"Please explain what is ""Meta-learning (computer science)""","Meta learning
is a subfield of machine learning where automatic learning algorithms are applied to metadata about machine learning experiments. As of 2017 the term had not found a standard interpretation, however the main goal is to use such metadata to understand how automatic learning can become flexible in solving learning problems, hence to improve the performance of existing learning algorithms or to learn (induce) the learning algorithm itself, hence the alternative term learning to learn.
Flexibility is important because each learning algorithm is based on a set of assumptions about the data, its inductive bias. This means that it will only learn well if the bias matches the learning problem. A learning algorithm may perform very well in one domain, but not on the next. This poses strong restrictions on the use of machine learning or data mining techniques, since the relationship between the learning problem (often some kind of database) and the effectiveness of different learning algorithms is not yet understood.
By using different kinds of metadata, like properties of the learning problem, algorithm properties (like performance measures), or patterns previously derived from the data, it is possible to learn, select, alter or combine different learning algorithms to effectively solve a given learning problem. Critiques of meta learning approaches bear a strong resemblance to the critique of metaheuristic, a possibly related problem. A good analogy to meta-learning, and the inspiration for Jürgen Schmidhuber's early work (1987) and Yoshua Bengio et al.'s work (1991), considers that genetic evolution learns the learning procedure encoded in genes and executed in each individual's brain. In an open-ended hierarchical meta learning system using genetic programming, better evolutionary methods can be learned by meta evolution, which itself can be improved by meta meta evolution, etc.

It has been used in many fields including econometrics, chemistry, and engineering. Also known as Tikhonov regularization, named for Andrey Tikhonov, it is a method of regularization of ill-posed problems.[a] It is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression, which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters. In general, the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias (see bias–variance tradeoff).
The theory was first introduced by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970 in their Technometrics papers “RIDGE regressions: biased estimation of nonorthogonal problems” and “RIDGE regressions: applications in nonorthogonal problems”. This was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysis.
Ridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear (highly correlated) independent variables—by creating a ridge regression estimator (RR). This provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate, as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived.",Fake,Real,0.9991455078125,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

3456,73768,"Please explain what is ""Test set""","In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.
The model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.
Successively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units—layers and layer widths—in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).
This simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.
Finally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term ""validation set"" is sometimes used instead of ""test set"" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).

Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.[clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.

It is related to infographics and scientific visualization. One distinction is that it's information visualization when the spatial representation (e.g., the page layout of a graphic design) is chosen, whereas it's scientific visualization when the spatial representation is given.
From an academic point of view, this representation can be considered as a mapping between the original data (usually numerical) and graphic elements (for example, lines or points in a chart). The mapping determines how the attributes of these elements vary according to the data. In this light, a bar chart is a mapping of the length of a bar to a magnitude of a variable. Since the graphic design of the mapping can adversely affect the readability of a chart, mapping is a core competency of Data visualization.

Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code.

It is the study of numerical methods that attempt at finding approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones. Numerical analysis finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, and in the 21st century also the life and social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts. Current growth in computing power has enabled the use of more complex numerical analysis, providing detailed and realistic mathematical models in science and engineering. Examples of numerical analysis include: ordinary differential equations as found in celestial mechanics (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies), numerical linear algebra in data analysis, and stochastic differential equations and Markov chains for simulating living cells in medicine and biology.
Before modern computers, numerical methods often relied on hand interpolation formulas, using data from large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead, but many of the same formulas continue to be used in software algorithms.
The numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings. A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.

Safety-related systems are those that do not have full responsibility for controlling hazards such as loss of life, severe injury or severe environmental damage.  The malfunction of a safety-involved system would only be that hazardous in conjunction with the failure of other systems or human error.

It is a theory in theoretical computer science. The word automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means ""self-acting, self-willed, self-moving"". An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite Automaton (FA) or Finite-State Machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton.  This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows).  As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function, which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments.
Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata.

3519,74505,Would I ever need credit card if my debit card is issued by MasterCard/Visa?,"My view is from the Netherlands, a EU country. Con: Credit cards are more risky. If someone finds your card, they can use it for online purchases without knowing any PIN, just by entering the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back. Worse, sometimes that information is stored in databases, and those get stolen by hackers! Also, you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them, stopped using the service, and be surprised about the charge later. Debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your PIN to do online payments (the ones I have in the Netherlands do, anyway), and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones. Con: Banks get a percentage of each credit card payment. Unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction (of, say, half a cent), credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more, a significant part of the profit margin. I feel this is just wrong. Con: automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment With debit cards, the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money isn't there, you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way (credit card after all, other bank account, cash, etc). When a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently, someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money wasn't there. So I had to pay interest, on something I bought weeks ago... Pro: Credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance. I've never used this and don't know how it works, but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges. Pro: Credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases I don't know how it is with Visa or MC-issued debit cards, but many US sites accept only cards that have number/expiration date/security code and thus my normal bank account debit card isn't useable.

It does not matter the store where you shop, you should check the garment quality because even at the expensive stores you can find bad quality.  Quality in Stitch: you should check the the garment stitch, look at the top and underneath stitches, watch for good and consist stitching pattern. especially the sides and armholes underneath of the garment.    Style is something personal. Everybody has different style, but stores are classified by age targeting. If you can find a store that usually made your style, good quality material at reasonable price. you should consider shop there. Most of the time, it will cost a little bit more or much more. BUT CHEAP IS EXPENSIVE!! you end up spending more money at the end of the year. Reasonable means a fair price for both parties, You and the seller.

Nowadays, technology makes settlements easy, and they usually occur at the end of the trading day.  The trading firms sum up their trades, figure out who they owe, and send lump sum settlements to the counterparties to their trades.

3542,74770,Apartment Security Deposit refunds in Maryland,"In Maryland, a landlord must hold your security deposit in an escrow account and pay you interest when returning the deposit.  The interest is simple interest; it does not compound. The interest rate that they must pay has changed over the last 43 years.  Before October 1, 2004, the rate was 4%.  Until January 1, 2015, the rate was 3%.  Currently, the rate is 1.5% OR the simple interest rate accrued at the daily U.S. Treasury yield curve rate for one year, as of the first business day of each year, whichever is greater.  (This year, the rate is 1.5%.)  Maryland's Department of Housing and Community Development has a Security Deposit Calculator for easy calculation of this interest; however, it only works for deposits since January 1, 2015. It is unclear to me whether the interest rate in effect is the one that was in place when the security deposit was made, or if the rate changes over the years.   At most, if you get 4% interest every year, I would expect you to receive $429.76, which is $158 + ($158 * 4% * 43).  The interest is accrued every 6 months, so you would not get any interest for the 3 months that you rented in your 44th year. (With the new law that took effect this year, interest is accrued monthly.) At least, if the interest rate changes with the new laws, I would expect you to receive $413.18, which is $158 + ($158 * 4% * 32.5) + ($158 * 3% * 10.25) + ($158 * 1.5% * 0.5). Some text on the Security Deposit Calculator suggests that the laws for Prince George's County are different than the rest of the state.  If you are in that county, you'll need to check the local ordinances to see what security deposit policies apply.",Fake,Real,0.9969492554664612,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Going long allows you to profit when the price is going up. In the opposite cases, you lose money. In order to make a profit in either of those situations, you have to accurately assess which way the price will trade over the period of time you are dealing with. If you make the wrong judgment, then you lose money because you'll either sell for a lower price than you bought (if you went long), or have to buy back at a higher price than you sold for (if you went short).

3549,74821,What is a stock warrant? How do warrants work?,"In Australia there are 2 type of warrants (I don't know if it is the same in the US, UK and other countries), the first are trading warrants and the second are instalment warrants. The trading warrants are exactly what it says, they are used for trading. They are similar to option and have calls and puts. As Cameron says, they differ from exchange traded options in that they are issued by the financial companies whereas options are generally written by other investors. Instalment warrants on the other hand are usually bought and sold by investors with a longer term view. There are no calls and puts and you can just go long with them. They are also issued by financial companies, and how they work is best explained through an example: if I was to buy a stock directly say I would be paying $50 per share, however an instalment warrant in the underlying stock may be offered for $27 per warrant. I could buy the warrant directly from the company when it is issued or on the secondary market just like shares. I would pay the $27 per warrant upfront, and then in 2 years time when the warrant expires I have the choice to purchase the underlying stock for the strike price of say $28, roll over to a new issue of warrants, sell it back on the secondary market, or let it expire, in which case I would receive any intrinsic value left in the warrant. You would have noticed that the warrant purchase price plus the strike price adds up to more than the share price ($55 compared to $50). This is the interest component inherent in the warrant which covers the borrowing costs until expiry, when you pay the second portion (the strike price) and receive the underlying shares. Another difference between Instalment warrants and trading warrants (and options) is that with instalment warrants you still get the full dividends just like the shares, but at a higher yield than the shares.",Fake,Real,0.9988839030265808,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Notes: As a tax deduction, your tax liability gets reduced at your marginal income tax rate, not the lowest tax rate (as would be the case for a tax credit). Yes, you still need receipts from your child care provider to support any claim. The non-refundable child tax credit a.k.a. amount for children under age 18 (line 367) introduced in 2007 is being eliminated starting in tax year 2015 coincident with the UCCB enhancement above. The credit could previously reduce tax liability by ~$340. The Family Tax Cut is being introduced and will be effective for tax year 2014. That is, when you file your 2014 income tax return in early 2015, you may be able to take advantage of this measure for income already earned in 2014. Provided a couple has at least one child under the age of 18, the Family Tax Cut will permit the transfer of up to $50,000 of taxable income from the higher income spouse's income tax return to the lower income spouse's return.

3554,74883,"If I buy a share from myself at a higher price, will that drive the price up so I can sell all my shares the higher price?","The market maker will always compare the highest bid and the lowest ask. A trade will happen if the highest bid is at least as high as the lowest ask. Adding one share (or a million shares) at a higher asking price, here: $210 instead of $200, will not have any effect at all. Nobody will buy the share.  Adding a bid for one share (or a million shares) at a higher bid price will trigger a sale. If you bid $210 for one share, you will pay $210 for one of the shares that were offered at $200. If you have $210 million in cash and add a bid for 1,000,000 AAPL at $210, you will pay $210 for all shares with an ask of $200.00, then $200.01, then $200.02 until you either bought all shares with an ask up to $210, or until you bought a million shares.  With AAPL, you probably bid the price up to $201 with a million shares, so you made lots of people very happy while losing about 10 million dollars. So let's say this is a much smaller company.  You have driven the share price up to $210, but there is nobody else bidding above $200. So nobody is going to buy your shares. Until some people think there is something going on and enter higher bids, but then some people will take advantage of this and ask lower than your $210. And there will be more people trying to make cash by selling their shares at a good price than people tricked into bidding over $200, so it is most likely that you lose out.

If they insist on having money upfront without delivering anything - unless it's a very big and known and established company you probably better off not doing it.

In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period.  On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee.  In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.  They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you don't get both.",Real,Fake,0.9975343942642212,,,,,,,,,,0,1,1
3568,75032,"Setting up a LLC for two partners in different states, what should we look into?","TL;DR: Get a tax adviser (EA/CPA licensed in your State) for tax issues, and a lawyer for the Operating Agreement, labor law and contract related issues. Some things are not suitable for DIY unless you know exactly what you're doing. We both do freelance work currently just through our personal names.   What kind of taxes are we looking into paying into the business   (besides setup of everything) compared to being a self proprietor?   (I'm seeing that the general answer is no, as long as income is <200k,   but not certain). Unless you decide to have your LLC taxed as a corporation, there's no change in taxes. LLC, by default, is a pass-through entity and all income will flow to your respective tax returns. From tax perspective, the LLC will be treated as a partnership. It will file form 1065 to report its income, and allocate the income to the members/partners on schedules K-1 which will be given to you. You'll use the numbers on the K-1 to transfer income allocated to you to your tax returns and pay taxes on that. Being out of state, will she incur more taxes from the money being now   filtered through the business? Your employee couldn't care less about your tax problems. She will continue receiving the same salary whether you are a sole proprietor or a LLC, or Corporatoin. What kind of forms are we looking into needing/providing when   switching to a LLC from freelance work? Normally we just get 1099's,   what would that be now? Your contract counterparts couldn't care less about your tax problems. Unless you are a corporation, people who pay you more than $600 a year must file a 1099. Since you'll be a partnership, you'll need to provide the partnership EIN instead of your own SSN, but that's the only difference. Are LLC's required to pay taxes 4 times per year? We would definitely   get an accountant for things, but being as this is side work, there   will be times where we choose to not take on clients, which could   cause multiple months of no income. Obviously we would save for when   we need to pay taxes, but is there a magic number that says ""you must   now pay four times per year"". Unless you choose to tax your LLC as a corporation, LLC will pay no taxes. You will need to make sure you have enough withholding to cover for the additional income, or pay the quarterly estimates. The magic number is $1000. If your withholding+estimates is $1000 less than what your tax liability is, you'll be penalized, unless the total withholding+estimates is more than 100% of your prior year tax liability (or 110%, depending on the amounts). The LLC would be 50% 50%, but that work would not always be that. We   will be taking on smaller project through the company, so there will   be times where one of us could potentially be making more money. Are   we setting ourselves up for disaster if one is payed more than the   other while still having equal ownership? Partnerships can be very flexible, and equity split doesn't have to be the same as income, loss or assets split. But, you'll need to have a lawyer draft your operational agreement which will define all these splits and who gets how much in what case.

3578,75086,Using P/E Ratio of an ETF to decide on asset mix,"P/E is a useful tool for evaluating the price of a company, but only in comparison to companies in similar industries, especially for industries with well-defined cash flows.  For example, if you compared Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) to Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE), you'll notice that HE has a significantly higher PE. All things being equal, that means that HE may be overpriced in comparison to ED. As an investor, you need to investigate further to determine whether that is true. HE is unique in that it is a utility that also operates a bank, so you need to take that into account. You need to think about what your goal is when you say that you are a ""conservative"" investor and look at the big picture, not a magic number. If conservative to you means capital preservation, you need to ensure that you are in investments that are diversified and appropriate. Given the interest rate situation in 2011, that means your bonds holding need to be in short-duration, high-quality securities. Equities should be weighted towards large cap, with smaller holdings of international or commodity-associated funds.

(b) A HELOC that was prime-1.5%.   The result was to mentally treat the HELOC as our emergency fund, but to enjoy the interest savings of over $16,500/yr for the $100K that had a sub-1% return.  When I first referenced this story, I came under criticism. Fair enough, it's not for everyone. Let's jump ahead. We owe $228K @3.5%. We had tapped the equity line for brief periods, but never over $20,000. When we lost our jobs, both of us, we had hit our number and are semi-retired now. Our retirement budget included the current mortgage payment, so we are in line for that dropping out of the budget in 12 years, and starting social security after that, which I did not include as part of the budget.  Note - when we lost our jobs, the severance was 6 month's pay, and we collected unemployment as well. The first 12 months were covered without tapping our retirement funds at all.

3589,75192,Investment Portfolio Setup for beginner,"Some thoughts: 1) Do you have a significant emergency fund (3-6 months of after-tax living expenses)? If not, you stand to take a significant loss if you have an unexpected need for cash that is tied up in investments. What if you lose/hate your job or your car breaks down? What if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live? Having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk. 2) Lagerbaer has a good suggestion. Given that if you'd reinvested your dividends, the S&P 500 has returned about 3.5% over the last 5 years, you may be able to get a very nice risk-free return.  3) Do you have access to employer matching funds, such as in a 401(k) at work? If you get a dollar-for-dollar match, that is a risk-free pre-tax 100% return and should be a high priority. 4) What do you mean by ""medium"" volatility? Given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation, it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15% or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If that would spook you, you may want to consider lowering your equity weights. A high quality bond fund may be a good fit. 5) Personally, I would avoid putting money into stocks that I didn't need back for 10 years. If you only want to tie your money up for 2-5 years, you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall, you won't have time to recover before you need your money back. The portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long-term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance, which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement. However, if your goals are to invest for 2-5 years only, your situation would be significantly different.  6) You can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence, but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees, unless you plan to liquidate assets. If you plan to buy a house, saving enough to avoid PMI is a good risk-free return on your money. 7) In general, and ETF or index fund is a good idea, the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term. There are many good choices a la Vanguard here to choose from. 8) Don't worry about ""Buy low, sell high"". Don't be a speculator, be an investor (that's my version of Anthony Bourdain's, ""don't be a tourist, be a traveler""). A speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at. An investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part-owner. If you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions, good for you - you can move to Wall Street and make millions. However, almost no one can do this consistently, and it doesn't seem worth it to me to try. I don't mean to discourage you from investing, just make sure you have your bases covered so that you don't have to cash out at a bad time. Best of luck! Edit Response to additional questions below. 1) Emergency fund. I would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents (money market, short-term CDs, etc.) until you've built up an emergency fund. It makes sense to want to make the ""best"" use of your money, but you also have to account for risk. My concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events, that you could lose a lot of money, or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt, and it would be prudent to self-insure against some of those risks. I would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account. Taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions/taxes/fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns. Ideally, you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns. There are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds. Just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month, you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility, even if they are less common. Using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this. 2) Invest at all? I would recommend starting an emergency fund, and then beginning to invest for retirement.

If stock markets keep performing like they have for the past 100 years, you can expect there will be a point within the next 60-or-so years your stocks will be higher in value than they were when you bought them. With funds you are paying the people managing them which means you are guaranteed to have pyramiding losses that your gains will have to offset. In your case, you are betting with no fundamental knowledge that S&P will be higher than now whenever you need the money which is not even supported by the above assumption.

Further, the fees you're going to pay to make your trades are very likely to outstrip your return, so you'd be upside down on it. This company has pretty negative financials, and in a world of cheap oil, alternative energy (and the companies that deal in it) are out of vogue, so they're not likely to see a turnaround anytime soon.

3599,75312,What factors you have do you count on to speculate effectively?,"Strategy would be my top factor.  While this may be implied, I do think it helps to have an idea of what is causing the buy and sell signals in speculating as I'd rather follow a strategy than try to figure things out completely from scratch that doesn't quite make sense to me. There are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along: Fundamental Analysis:Fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health, its management and competitive advantages, and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up analysis and top down analysis. The term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis. Technical Analysis:In finance, technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. There are tools like ""Stock Screeners"" that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix.  There are various strategies one could use.  Wikipedia under Stock Speculator lists: ""Several different types of stock trading strategies or approaches exist including day trading, trend following, market making, scalping (trading), momentum trading, trading the news, and arbitrage.""  Thus, I'd advise research what approach are you wanting to use as the ""Make it up as we go along losing real money all the way"" wouldn't be my suggested approach. There is something to be said for there being numerous columnists and newsletter peddlers if you want other ideas but I would suggest having a strategy before putting one's toe in the water.",Fake,Real,0.998976707458496,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

This is why you see a whole range of prices.  Not all possible stock values are represented, the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable.  In this case the choices are even units, for an expensive stock they may be spaced even farther apart than this. The top of the chart says it's for June.

While the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100. The left side of the chart shows calls.  Suppose you sell a call at 19 (the top of the chart)  The last such trade would have gotten you a premium of 9.70 per share (the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26.)  Note the volume, bid and ask columns though--you're not going to get 9.70 for such a call as there is no buyer.  The most anybody is offering at present is 7.80 a share. Now, lets look farther down in the chart--say, a strike price of 30.  The last trade was only .10--people think it's very unlikely that FB will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price.  If FB stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away.  If it's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they'll exercise the option, take your shares and pay you 30 for them.  Note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call, you can't back out later if it becomes a bad deal. Going over to the other side of the chart with the puts: Here the transaction goes the other way, come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price.  Lets look at the same values we did before.  19?  There's no trading, you can't do it. 30?  Here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put.

I read an article that the most common way to end up with a 23%+ credit card was to start out with a 0% balance transfer.  One thing that is often overlooked is that the transfer fee paid jacks up the stated rate of the card.   In the end, get out of consumer debt, have an emergency fund, then start investing.

3619,75591,What is a call spread and how does it work?,"A bullish (or 'long') call spread is actually two separate option trades.  The A/B notation is, respectively, the strike price of each trade. The first 'leg' of the strategy, corresponding to B, is the sale of a call option at a strike price of B (in this case $165).  The proceeds from this sale, after transaction costs, are generally used to offset the cost of the second 'leg'. The second 'leg' of the strategy, corresponding to A, is the purchase of a call option at a strike price of A (in this case $145). Now, the important part: the payoff.  You can visualize it as so. This is where it gets a teeny bit math-y.  Below, P is the profit of the strategy, K1 is the strike price of the long call, K2 is the strike price of the short call, T1 is the premium paid for the long call option at the time of purchase, T2 is the premium received for the short call at the time of sale, and S is the current price of the stock.  For simplicity's sake, we will assume that your position quantity is a single option contract and transaction costs are zero (which they are not). P = (T2 - max(0, S - K2)) + (max(0, S - K1) - T1) Concretely, let's plug in the strikes of the strategy Nathan proposes, and current prices (which I pulled from the screen).  You have: P = (1.85 - max(0, 142.50 - 165)) - (max(0, 142.50 - 145)) = -$7.80 If the stock goes to $150, the payoff is -$2.80, which isn't quite break even -- but it may have been at the time he was speaking on TV. If the stock goes to $165, the payoff is $12.20. Please do not neglect the cost of the trades!  Trading options can be pretty expensive depending on the broker.

Here are the key parts: On line at the bottom of the list of funds there is an entire screen   of grey-faded micro print which includes this telling disclosure: TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from certain ETFs (exchange-traded     funds) that participate in the commission-free ETF program for     shareholder, administrative and/or other services. In other words, TD Ameritrade is now enforcing a pay-to-play for their   so-called commission-free exchange-traded funds. They are willing to   forego their $6.95 trading commission in favor of remuneration   directly from the ETF vendors. Because Vanguard refuses to pay such   money to custodians, they are no longer being allowed to play. and Joseph Giannone, a TD Ameritrade spokesman, was quoted as saying,   ""With any business decision, client needs are paramount, but the   underlying economics of programs can’t be ignored. ... In line with   industry practices, certain providers pay servicing, administrative or   other fees. Vanguard elected not to be a part of the new program."" So basically it sounds like Vanguard, and presumably iShares as well, were unwilling to pay TD Ameritrade to continue offering their ETFs commission-free.",Fake,Real,0.9974017143249512,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

So you don't really stand to lose much in this scenario, and can make a decent gain in this scenario.

In other words, the $53k is a cap: you can contribute a percentage of your earnings, but you can never contribute more than $53k, even if you make so much money that 20% of your earnings would be more than that. (The difference between 20% and 25% in the two sources appears to reflect a difference in contribution limits depending on whether you are making contributions for employees, or for yourself as a self-employed individual; see Publication 560.  The difference between $50k and $53k is due to the two pages being written in different years; the limits increase each year.)",Fake,Real,0.9996742010116576,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

3630,75731,Steps to buying a home,"Pre-edit, Pete mentioned that he feels real estate agents would (a) like you to buy as much house as you afford, and (b) would love to show you three houses and have you choose one.  As a real estate agent myself, I believe his warnings were understated. As with any industry, there are good and bad people. Agents are paid to move houses. If the median US home is under $200K, and commissions average say 5%, the $10,000 to be gained is split between the buyer brokerage and selling agent. The $5000 to each is then shared with 'the house.' So, this sale would net me $2500, gross. Move one a week, and the income is great, one per month, not so much. Tire kickers will waste an agent's time for a potential decision to wait another year and continue renting. Their obligation is to tell you the truth, but not to offer financial advice.  Remember the mortgage crisis? It seems the banks and brokers aren't watching out for you either. They will tell you what they'll lend you, but not what you can afford. These numbers are worlds apart.  I strongly recommend a 20% downpayment. The FHA PMI calculator shows that a 90% LTV (i.e. a 10% downpayment) for a $100K house will cost you $1200/yr in PMI. Think about this. For the $10,000 that you didn't put down, you are paying an extra $1200 each year. This is on top of the interest, so even at 5%, that last $10,000 is costing nearly 17%. If you can't raise that $10K (or whatever 10% is on that house) in cheaper funds, you should hold off. Using the 401(k) loan for this purpose is appropriate, yet emotionally charged. As if suck loans are written by the devil himself.  ""Buy the biggest house you can""? No. I have a better idea. Buy the smallest place you can tolerate. I have a living room (in addition to family room) that has been used 3 times in 20 years. A dining room we actually use. Twice per year. When your house is 50% too big, you pay 50% more property tax, more utility bills, and more maintenance.

I haven't worked out the numbers, but I suspect that you could achieve similar results by simply paying ahead -- making even one extra payment per year will take 7-9 years off of a 30 year loan.

3654,76077,"As a Sole Proprietor, will “employer” Solo 401k contributions count towards gross income?","This seems to depend on what kind of corporation you have set up. If you're set up as a sole proprietor, then the Solo 401k contributions, whether employee or employer, will be deducted from your gross income.  Thus they don't reduce it. If you're set up as an S-Corp, then the employer contributions, similar to large employer contributions, will be deducted from wages, and won't show up in Box 1 on your W-2, so they would reduce your gross income.  (Note, employee contributions also would go away from Box 1, but would still be in Box 3 and 5 for FICA/payroll tax purposes). This is nicely discussed in detail here. The IRS page that discusses this in more (harder to understand) detail is here. Separately, I think a discussion of ""Gross Income"" is merited, as it has a special definition for sole proprietorships. The IRS defines it in publication 501 as: Gross income.    Gross income is all income you receive in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from tax. If you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state, half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours. For a list of community property states, see Community property states under Married Filing Separately, later. Self-employed persons.    If you are self-employed in a business that provides services (where products are not a factor), your gross income from that business is the gross receipts. If you are self-employed in a business involving manufacturing, merchandising, or mining, your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold. In either case, you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources. So I think that regardless of 401(k) contributions, your gross income is your gross receipts (if you're a contractor, it's probably the total listed on your 1099(s)).",Fake,Real,0.9935634136199952,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

These are things that can be quickly, and precisely answered through a conversation with your broker. You can request info on the performance of the fund you are invested in from the broker.  They are required to disclose this information to you.   They can give you the performance of the fund overall, as well as break down for you the specific stocks and bonds that make up the fund, and how they are performing. Talk about what kind of fund it is.  If your projected retirement date is far in the future your fund should probably be on the aggressive side.  Ask what the historic average is for the fund you're in.  Ask about more aggressive funds, or less if you prefer a lower average but more stable performance.  Your broker should be able to adequately, and in most cases accurately, set your expectation. Also ask about fees.  Good brokerages charge reasonable fees, that are typically based on the gains the fund makes, not your total investment.  Make sure you understand what you are paying. Even without knowing the management fees, your growth this year should be of concern.  It is exceptionally low, in a year that showed good gains in many market sectors.  Speak with your broker and decide if you will stick with this fund or have your IRA invest in a different fund. Finally JW8 makes a great point, in that your fund may perform well or poorly over any given short term, but long term your average should fall within the expected range for the type of fund you're invested in (though, not guaranteed).

If you're a sole proprietor - then you could probably open a personal account and just use it, and never tell them that is actually a business. However, depending on your volume of operations, they may switch you on their own to business account by the pattern of your transactions. For corporations, you cannot use a personal account since the corporation is a separate legal entity that owns the funds. Also, you're generally required to separate corporate and personal funds to keep the limited liability protection (which is why you have the corporation to begin with). Generally, business accounts have much higher volumes and much more transactions than personal accounts, and it costs more for the banks to run them. In the US, some banks offer free, or very low-cost, business accounts for small businesses that don't need too many transactions. I'm sure if you shop around, you'll find those in Canada as well.",Fake,Real,0.8226191997528076,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

3672,76226,Whats the difference between day trading and flipping and their tax implications?,"Flipping usually refers to real-estate transaction: you buy a property, improve/renovate/rehabilitate it and resell it quickly. The distinction between flipper and investor is similar to the distinction between trader and investor, even though the tax code doesn't explicitly refer to house flipping. Gains on house flipping can be considered as active business gain or passive activity income, which are treated differently: passive income goes on Schedule E and Schedule D, active income goes on Schedule C. The distinction between passive and active is based on the characteristics of the activity (hours you spent on it, among other things). Trading income can similarly be considered as either passive (Schedule D/E treatment) or active (Schedule C treatment). Here's what the IRS has to say about traders: Special rules apply if you are a trader in securities, in the business   of buying and selling securities for your own account. This is   considered a business, even though you do not maintain an inventory   and do not have customers. To be engaged in business as a trader in   securities, you must meet all of the following conditions: The following facts and circumstances should be considered in   determining if your activity is a securities trading business: If the nature of your trading activities does not qualify as a   business, you are considered an investor... Investor, in this context, means passive income treatment (Schedule D/E). However, even if your income is considered active (Schedule C), stock sale proceeds are not subject to the self-employment tax. As you can see, there's no specific definition, but the facts and circumstances matter. You may be considered a trader by the IRS, or you may not. You may want to be considered a trader (for example to be able to make a mark-to-market election), or you may not.

3674,76247,First time investor wanting to invest in index funds especially Vanguard,"Congratulations on deciding to save money and choosing to invest it. One thing to know about mutual funds including index funds is that they typically require a minimum investment of a few thousand dollars, $3000 being a typical amount, unless the investment is in an IRA in which case $1000 might be a minimum. In some cases, automated monthly investments of $50 or $100 might need to be set up if you are beginning with a small balance. There is nothing wrong with your approach. You now should go and look at the various requirements for specific index funds. The Fidelity and Vanguard families are good choices and both offer very low-cost index funds to choose from, but different funds can have different requirements regarding minimum investments etc. You also have a choice of which index you want to follow, the S&P 500 Index, MidCap Indexes, Small-Cap Indexes, Total Stock Market Indexes etc., but your choice might be limited  until you have more money to invest because of minimum investment rules etc.   Most important, after you have made your choice, I urge you to not look every day, or even every month, to see how your investment is doing. You will save yourself a lot of anxiety and will save yourself from making wrong decisions.  Far too many investors ignore the maxim ""Buy Low, Sell High"" and pull money out of what should be long-term investments at the first flicker of a downturn and end up buying high and selling low. Finally, the time is approaching when most stock funds will be declaring dividends and capital gains distributions. If you invest now, you may end up with a paper profit on which you will have to pay taxes (in  non-tax-advantaged accounts) on your 2012 tax return (this is called ""buying a dividend""), and so you might want to spend some time investigating now, but actually make the investment in late December after your chosen fund has made its distributions (the date for this will be on the fund's web site) or in early 2013.",Fake,Real,0.6378718614578247,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

You were ultimately charged for two drinks, and the extra $1.29 that you were charged was refunded. Since it happened three times, you have to decide how badly you want these drinks in the future.

3677,76286,Profiting from the PWC Money Tree,"The hardest part seems to be knowing exactly when to sell the stock.  Well yes, that's the problem with all stock investing. Reports come out all the time, sometimes even from very smart people with no motivation to lie, about expected earnings for this company, or for that industry. Whether those predictions come true is something you will only find out with time. What you are considering is using financial information available to you (and equally available to the public) to make investment choices. This is called 'fundamental analysis'; that is, the analysis of the fundamentals of a business and what it should be worth. It forms the basis of how many investment firms decide where to put their money.  In a perfectly 'efficient' market, all information available to the public is immediately factored into the market price for that company's stock. ie: if a bank report states with absolute certainty (through leaked documents) that Coca-Cola is going to announce 10% revenue growth tomorrow, then everyone will immediately buy Coca-Cola stock today, and then tomorrow there would be no impact. Even if PwC is 100% accurate in its predictions, if the rest of the market agrees with them, then the price at the time of IPO would equal the future value of the cashflows, meaning there would be no gain unless results surpassed expectations. So what you are proposing is to take one sliver of the information available to the public (have you also read all publicly available reports on those businesses and their industries?), and using that to make a high risk investment. Are you going to do better than the investment firms that have teams of researchers and years of experience in the investment world? You can do quite well by picking individual stocks, but you can also lose a lot of money if you do it haphazardly. Be aware that there is risk in doing any type of investing. There is higher than average risk if you invest in equities ('the stock market'). There is higher risk still, if you pick individual stocks. There is yet even higher risk, if you pick small startup companies.  There are some specific interesting side-elements with your proposal to purchase stock about to have an IPO - those are better dealt with in a separate question if you want more information; search this site for 'IPO' and you should find a good starting point. In short, the company about to go public will hire a firm of analysts who will try to calculate the best price the public will accept for an offering of shares. Stock often goes up after IPO, but not always. Sometimes the company doesn't even fill its full IPO order, adding a new type of risk to a potential investor, that the stock will drop on day 1. Consider an analogy outside the investing world:  Let's say Auto Trader magazine prints an article that says ""all 2015 Honda Civics are worth $15,000 if they have less than 50,000 Miles."" Assume you have no particular knowledge about cars. If you read this article, and you see an ad in the paper the next day for a Honda Civic with 40k miles, should you buy it for $14k? The answer is not without more research. And even if you determine enough about cars to find one for $14k that you can reasonably sell for $15k, there's a whole world of mechanics out there who buy and sell cars for a living, and they have an edge both because they can repair the cars themselves to sell for more, and also because they have experience to spot low-offers faster than you. And if you pick a clunker (or a stock that doesn't perform even when everyone expected it would), then you could lose some serious money. As with buying and selling individual stocks, there is money to be made from car trading, but that money gets made by people who really know what they're doing. People who go in without full information are the ones who lose money in the long run.",Fake,Real,0.9134226441383362,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3685,76328,Can an IRA be taxed?,"The Motley Fool article is correct that if you earn UBTI over $1000, you will need to pay the tax, even if held in an IRA.   C-corps won't generate UBTI, so you're fine with those.  For non-C-corps, the most common are REITs, MLPs, and BDCs.   REITs  These typically invest in either real estate property or mortgages.  The ones that invest in mortgages are sometimes notated: mREITs, and can occasionally generate UBTI.  Tip: Don't let this stop you from investing in REITs in your IRA.  REITs can be a great source of income and are best held in an IRA since the income will be tax free vs. your ordinary income tax bracket if held in a taxable account.  Some examples of mREITs would be NLY, CIM, AGNC.  Some property REITs would be: O, SNR, OHI, EQR. https://seekingalpha.com/article/1257351-tax-bomb-mortgage-reits-triggering-ubit MLPs Master Limited Partnerships are also pass-through entities, like REITs, but have the additional complication that most issue K-1 forms at tax time.  K-1s can be very complex when the MLP owns assets across state boundaries, which is why I actually PREFER to hold MLPs in my IRA (against the advice of M.

They range from large medical expenses to losing your job to being sued to major home or car repairs to who-knows-what.

If you live in a country with national health insurance and there is near-zero chance that you will have any need to go outside this system, you are living with your parents and they are equipped to handle any home repairs, you ride the bus or subway and don't own a car so that's not an issue, etc etc, maybe there just isn't any likely scenario where you'd suddenly need cash.

I'm trying to put my kids through college, so if I lost my job, even if unemployment benefits were adequate to live on, they wouldn't pay for college.

I might suddenly be charged with a crime that I didn't commit and need a lawyer to defend me. Etc. So in a very real sense, everyone's situation is different.

This coverage is simply called ""Vacant home insurance"", but not all companies are willing to offer this coverage. Unfortunately, in New York, insurers can also legally drop your standard homeowners' coverage if they become aware that your property has become vacant for 30 days or more. The Insurer's Concerns Typically, a ""standard"" homeowners policy will have an exclusion clause for vacant homes. The insurance company's concern is that without someone in the home, they will be at risk for break-ins, squatters and vandalism. If you've ever seen ""Flip Men"" on Spike, you'll know this is a serious concern (great show, by the way). They will use a risk model to calculate an estimated risk for the property (this is why a seasonal vacation home in a sparsely-populated area is often less of a concern than a family home in an urban area). If they estimate the risk to be low, some insurance companies will allow to you buy back that exclusion so that vacant properties are covered. In your case, they have probably decided that either: Your Options First, you need to find a company that is comfortable with taking on the extra risk of a vacant home. This will vary quite a bit by location, but the main ones are Farmer's (they use the Foremost brand name in New York) and Castle Rock.

Additionally, do you know anyone you completely trust (relative, unemployed friend) that might want to live in your old house rent-free for a while? This could work out for you if they are willing to keep the place 100% clean around the clock so that you can show the house at any time.

The standard way of computing the market capitalization of a firm is to take the price of its common stock and multiply by the number of outstanding common stock shares.  If you do this using the numbers from google's site you get around $13.4B.  This can be verified by going to other sites like yahoo finance and bloomberg, which have the correct market capitalization already computed. The Whole Foods acquisition appears to be very cut-and-dry.  Investors will be compensated with $42 cash per share. Why are google finance's numbers wrong for market cap?  Sometimes people will add other things to ""market capitalization,"" like the value of the firm's debt and other debt-like securities.  My guess is that google has done something like this.

After that. under the US Uniform Commerical Code they are considered ""stale checks"" and banks need not accept them. My experience is that they generally won't -- but you probably shouldn't count on that, either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks. The check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money -- but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued, its value for that purpose may be limited. You can try depositing it and see what happens. If that doesn't work (or you don't want to bother trying it) you can contact the retirement plan, point out that this check went uncashed, and ask them to send you a replacement. If they haven't already done so (you might want to check your own records for that), there shouldn't be any problem with this.

According to their web-page, Frankfort exchange has a Specialist Trading on Frankfurt Floor service which has slightly different trading hours.  I suspect what Google and Yahoo show as Frankfort exchange is this manual trading via a Specialist (opposed to Xetra electronic trading). To answer your question, the stock you're having is exactly the same, meaning if you bought an ETR:BMW you can still sell it on FRA (by calling a FRA Trading Floor Specialist which will probably cost you a fee). On the other hand, for the portfolio valuation and performance assessments you should only use ETR:BMW prices, because it is way more liquid, and thus better reflect the current market valuation.",Fake,Real,0.9204633831977844,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0
3707,76512,How to double-entry bookkeep money incoming from sold items,"If you were a business, all your assets would have a dollar value, so when you sold them you'd decrease the amount of assets by that amount and increase in cash, and if there was a profit on the sale it would go in as income, if there was loss it would count as a cost (or a loss)... so if there was a profit it would increase Equity, a loss then it would decrease Equity.  Since it's not really worthwhile doing a estimated cost for everything that you have, I'd just report it as income like you are doing and let the amount of equity increase proportionately. So, implicitly you always had roughly that amount of equity, but some of it was in the form of assets, and now you're liquidating those assets so the amount shows up in GnuCash. When you buy new things you might sell later, you could consider adding them as assets to keep track of this explicitly (but even then you have problems-- the price of things changes with time and you might not want to keep up with those price changes, it's a lot of extra work for a family budget) -- for stuff you already have it's better to treat things as you are doing and just treat the money as income-- it's easier and doesn't really change anything-- you always had that in equity, some of it was just off the books and now you are bringing it into the books.",Fake,Real,0.5947526693344116,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

The thing I like (as a software development contractor) is that I don't have to know or worry about different ledger accounts, or journal entries, or any of the other weird accounting things, etc. Most cloud accounting software claim to simplify accounting ""so that you can concentrate on running your business"" whereas the reality is that you still have to spend ages learning how to be an accountant just to fill it in correctly.

3715,76611,"How should I be contributing to my 401(k), traditional or Roth?","The Finance Buff discusses why the Roth 401k is often disadvantaged compared to a Traditional 401k in the article The Case Against the Roth 401k, including the following reasons (paraphrased): Contributions to the 401k come from the ""top"" of your highest tax bracket rate but withdrawals fill in from the ""bottom"".  For example, suppose you are in the 28% tax bracket.  Every marginal dollar you contribute to the Traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by .28 cents.  However, when withdrawing, the first $10,150 of income is tax-free (from standard deduction and exemption, 2014 numbers; $20,300 for married couples, joint filing).  The next dollars are at the 10% tax bracket, and so on.  This is an advantage for the Traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing, a reasonable assumption. Avoid High State Income Tax. There are many states that have low or no state income tax.  If you live in a state with a high income tax, paying tax now through the Roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate. Avoid triggering credit phaseouts. Many tax credits (e.g. student loan interest, child tax credit, Hope credit, Roth IRA eligibility, etc.) begin phasing out as your income increases.  Contributing to the Traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits. As described in the article, if these items don't apply, contributing to the Roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification.",Fake,Real,0.9597644209861756,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0
3716,76632,How to Create Personal Balance Sheet and Budget Plan for Several Accounts,"As your financial situation becomes more complex, it becomes increasingly more difficult to keep track of everything with a simple spreadsheet.  It is much easier to work with software that is specifically designed for personal finances. A good program will allow you to keep track of as many accounts as you want.  A great program will completely separate the different account balances (location of the money) from the budget category balances (purpose of the money).  Let me explain: When you set up the software, you will enter in all of your different bank accounts with their balances.  Perhaps you have three savings accounts and two checking accounts.  It doesn't matter.  When you are done entering those, the software will total them up, and the next job you have is assigning this money into different budget categories: your spending plan.  For example, you might put some of it into a grocery category, some into an entertainment category, some will be assigned to pay your next car insurance bill, and some will be an emergency fund.  (These categories are completely customizable, and your budget can be as broad or as detailed as you wish.)  When you deposit your paycheck, you assign that new income into budget categories as well.  It doesn't matter at this point which accounts your money are located in; the only thing that matters is that you own this money and you have access to it.  Now, you might want to use a certain account for a certain budget category, but you are not required to do so.  (For example, your grocery category money will probably be in your checking account, since you will be spending from it regularly.  Your emergency fund will hopefully be in an account that earns a little higher interest.) Once you take this approach, you might find you don't need as many bank accounts as you thought you did, because the software does the job of separating your money into different ""accounts"" for different purposes. I've written before about the different categories of personal finance software.  YNAB, Mvelopes, and EveryDollar are three examples of software that will take this approach of separating the concepts of the bank account and the budget category.",Real,Fake,0.9172802567481996,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0

3726,76748,Starting a side business slowly,"This is a great question! I've been an entrepreneur and small business owner for 20+ years and have started small businesses in 3 states that grew into nice income streams for me. I've lived off these businesses for 20+ years, so I know it can be done! First let me start by saying that the rules, regulations, requirements and laws for operating a business (small or large) legally, for the most part, are local laws and regulations. Depending on what your business does, you may have some federal rules to follow, but for the most part, it will be your locality (state, county, city) that determines what you'll have to do to comply and be ""legal"". Also, though it might be better in some cases to incorporate (and even required in some circumstances), you don't always have to. There are many small businesses (think landscapers, housekeepers, babysitters, etc.) that get income from their ""business operations"" and do so as ""individuals"". Of course, everyone has to pay taxes - so as long as you property record your income (and expenses) and properly file your tax returns every year, you are ""income tax legal"".  I won't try to answer the income tax question here, though, as that can be a big question. Also, though you certainly can start a business on your own without hiring lawyers or other professionals (more on that below), when it comes to taxes, I definitely recommend you indeed plan to hire a tax professional (even if it's something like H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt, etc). In some cities, there might even be ""free"" tax preparation services by certain organizations that want to help the community and these are often available even to small businesses. In general, income taxes can be complicated and the rules are always changing. I've found that most small business owners that try to file their own taxes generally end up paying a lot more taxes than they're required to, in essence, they are overpaying! Running a business (and making a profit) can be hard enough, so on to of that, you don't need to be paying more than you are required to!  Also, I am going to assume that since it sounds like it would be a business of one (you), that you won't have a Payroll. That is another area that can be complicated for sure. Ok, with those generics out of the way, let me tackle your questions related to starting and operating a business, since you have the ""idea for your business"" pretty figured out. Will you have to pay any substantial amount of money to attorneys or advisors or accountants or to register with the government? Not necessarily. Since the rules for operating a business legally vary by your operating location (where you will be providing the service or performing your work), you can certainly research this on your own. It might take a little time, but it's doable if you stick with it. Some resources: The state of Florida (where I live) has an excellent page at: http://www.myflorida.com/taxonomy/business/starting%20a%20business%20in%20florida/ You might not be in Florida, but almost every state will have something similar. What all do I need to do to remain on the right side of the law and the smart side of business?  All of the answers above still apply to this question, but here are a few more items to consider: You will want to keep good records of all expenses directly related to the business. If you license some content (stock images) for example, you'll want to document receipts. These are easy usually as you know ""directly"". If you subscribe to the Apple Developer program (which you'll need to if you intend to sell Apps in the Apple App Stores), the subscription is an expense against your business income, etc. You will want to keep good records of indirect costs. These are not so easy to ""figure out"" (and where a good accountant will help you when this becomes significant) but these are important and a lot of business owners hurt themselves by not considering these. What do I mean? Well, you need an ""office"" in order to produce your work, right? You might need a computer, a phone, internet, electricity, heat, etc. all of which allow you to create a ""working environment"" that allows you to ""produce your product"". The IRS (and state tax authorities) all provide ways for you to quantify these and ""count them"" as legitimate business expenses. No, you can't use 100% of your electric bill (since your office might be inside your home, and the entire bill is not ""just"" for your business) but you are certainly entitled to some part of that bill to count as a business expense. Again, I don't want to get too far down the INCOME TAX rabbit hole, but you still need to keep track of what you spend! You must keep good record of ALL your income. This is especially important when you have money coming in from various sources (a payroll, gifts from friends, business income from clients and/or the App Stores, etc.) Do not just assume that copies of your bank deposits tell the whole story. Bank statements might tell you the amount and date of a deposit, but you don't really know ""where"" that money came from unless you are tracking it! The good news is that the above record keeping can be quite easy with something like Quicken or QuickBooks (or many many other such popular programs.) You will want to ensure you have the needed licenses (not necessarily required at all for a lot of small businesses, especially home based businesses.) Depending on your business activity, you might want to consider business liability insurance. Again, this will depend on your clients and/or other business entities you'll be dealing with. Some might require you to have some insurance.  Will be efforts even be considered a business initially until some amount of money actually starts coming in?  This might be a legal / accountant question as to the very specific answer from the POV of the law and taxing authorities. However, consider that not all businesses make any money at all, for a long time, and they definitely ""are a business"". For instance, Twitter was losing money for a long time (years) and no one would argue they were not a business. Again, deferring to the attorneys/cpas here for the legal answer, the practical answer is that you're performing ""some"" business activity when you start creating a product and working hard to make it happen! I would consider ""acting as"" a business regardless! What things do I need to do up-front and what things can I defer to later, especially in light of the fact that it might be several months to a couple years before any substantial income starts coming in? This question's answer could be quite long. There are potentially many items you can defer.  However, one I can say is that you might consider deferring incorporation. An individual can perform a business activity and draw income from it legally in a lot of situations. (For tax purposes, this is sometimes referred to as ""Schedule-C"" income.) I'm not saying incorporation is a bad thing (it can shield you from a lot of issues), but I am saying that it's not necessary on day 1 for a lot of small businesses. Having said that, this too can be easy to do on your own. Many companies offer services so you can incorporate for a few hundred dollars. If you do incorporate, as a small business of one person, I would definitely consider a tax concept called an ""S-Corp"" to avoid paying double taxes.)

But if it was available for rent (i.e.: you started advertising, you hired a property manager, or made any other step towards renting it out), but you just didn't happen to find a tenant yet - then you cannot. So it depends on the facts and circumstances. I've read that if I treat this house as a rental property, then the renovation cost is a capital expenditure that I can claim on my taxes by depreciating it over 28 years. That is correct. 27.5 years, to be exact. I've also read that if I treat this house as a personal second home, then I cannot do that because the renovation costs are considered non-deductible personal expenses. That is not correct. In fact, in both cases the treatment is the same. Renovation costs are added to your basis. In case of rental, you get to depreciate the house. Since renovations are considered part of the house, you get to depreciate them too. In case of a personal use property, you cannot depreciate. But the renovation costs still get added to the basis. These are not expenses. But does mortgage interest get deducted against my total income or only my rental income? If it is a personal use second home - you get to deduct the mortgage interest up to a limit on your Schedule A. Depending on your other deductions, you may or may not have a tax benefit. If it is a rental - the interest is deducted from the rental income only on your Schedule E. However, there's no limit (although some may be deferred if the deduction is more than the income) if you're renting at fair market value. Any guidance would be much appreciated! Here's the guidance: if it is a rental - treat it as a rental. Otherwise - don't.",Fake,Real,0.997529923915863,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0
3728,76759,Why do dishonour fees exist?,"In the United States, many banks aim to receive $ 100 per year per account in fees and interest markup.  There are several ways that they can do this on a checking account.  These examples assume that there is a 3 % difference between low-interest-rate deposit accounts and low-interest rate loans. Or some combination of these markups that adds up to $ 100 / year.  For example:  A two dollar monthly fee = $ 24 / year, plus a $ 2,000 average balance at 0.05% = $ 29 / year, plus $ 250 / month in rewards debit card usage = $ 24 / year, plus $ 2 / month in ATM fees = $ 24 / year. Before it was taken over by Chase Manhattan in 2008, Washington Mutual had a business strategy of offering ""free"" checking with no monthly fees, no annual fees, and no charges (by Washington Mutual) for using ATMs.  The catch was that the overdraft fees were not free.

The facts in the article below seem to point to the ability for the LLC to contribute profit sharing of up to 25% of the wages it paid SE tax on.  What part of the SE tax is that?  I assume the spirit of the law is to only allow the 25% on the taxable portion of the income, but given that I would have crossed the SS portion of SE tax, I am not 100%.

Like you mentioned, unqualified covered calls suspend the holding period of your stock.  For example you sell a deep in the money call (sometimes called the last write) on a stock you have held for 5 years, the covered call is classified as unqualified, the holding period is suspened and the gain or loss on the stock will be treated as short-term. Selling out of the money calls or trading in an IRA account keeps things simple. The details below have been summarized from an article I found at investorsguide.com.  The article also talks about the implications of rolling a call forward and tax situations where it may be advantageous to write unqualified covered calls (basically when you have a large deferred long term loss). http://www.investorguide.com/article/12618/qualified-covered-calls-special-rules-wo/ Two criterion must be met for a covered call to be considered a qualified covered call (QCC). 1) days to expiration must be greater than 30 2) strike price must be greater than or equal to the first available in the money strike price below the previous day's closing price for a particular stock.  Additionally, if the previous day's closing price is $25 or less, the strike price of the call being sold must be greater than 85% of yesterday's closing price. 2a) If the previous day's closing price is greater than 60.01 and less than or equal to $150, days to experation is between 60-90, as long as the strike price of the call is greater than 85% of the previous days close and less than 10 points in the money, you can write a covered call two strikes in the money 2c) If the previous day's closing price is greater than $150 and days till expiration is greater than 90, you can write a covered call two strikes in the money.",Fake,Real,0.999149203300476,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

The credit limit and balance should also stay the same. http://blog.credit.com/2014/02/lost-or-stolen-credit-card-hurt-your-credit-scores-76724/ How Issuers Report Replacement Cards We asked the major card issuers how they report replacement cards to credit reporting agencies: American Express: The new card has the same open date and “Member Since” year as the previous card. The balance on the old account number is transferred to the new account number. All payment history transfers over. Bank of America: All transactions and account history are transferred to the new account number when there is a card replacement or renewal. Capital One: The new account number with all the original account data (original open date, etc.) is reported along with a notification to the bureaus that the new account number is replacing the old.  The two tradelines can then be ‘merged’ into one, so that all the applicable payment history, balance, etc. is now under the new account number. Chase: The original tradeline does not change.

3737,76872,What are some factors I should consider when choosing between a CPA and tax software,"I'm glad keshlam and Bobby mentioned there are free tools, both from the IRS and private software companies.  Also search for Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) in your area for individual help with your return. A walk-in tax clinic strength is tax preparation.  CPAs and EAs provide a higher level of service.  For example, they compile and review your prior year's return and your current year, although that is not relevant to your current situation.  EAs and CPAs are allowed to represent you before the IRS.  They can directly meet or contact the IRS and navigate audits and other requests on your behalf.  Outside of tax season, an accountant can help you with tax planning and other taxable events. Some people do not hire a CPA or EA until they need representation.  Establishing a relationship and familiarity with an accountant now can save time and money if you do anticipate you will need representation later.  Part of what makes the tax code complicated is it can use very specific definitions of a common word.  Furthermore, the specific definition of a phrase or word can change between publications.  Also, the tax code uses all-encompassing definitions and provide detailed and lengthy lists that are not exhaustive; you may not find your situation listed or described in the tax code, yet you are responsible for reporting your taxable events.  The best software cannot navigate you through your tax situation like an accountant. Lastly, some of the smartest people I have met are accountants and to get the most out of meeting with them you should be as familiar as possible with your position.  The more familiar you are with accounting, the more advanced knowledge they can share with you.

3742,76959,Is it ever logical to not deposit to a matched 401(k) account?,"Some have suggested you can put the money in the 401k then take a loan to pay off the student loan debt.  Some things to consider before doing that: Check your 401k plan first.  Some plans allow you to continue paying on a loan if you leave the company, some do not.  If you have to change jobs before you pay back the 401k loan, you may only have 90 days to completely pay the loan or the IRS will treat this as an early withdrawal, which means taxes and penalties.  If you don't have another job lined up, this is going to make things much worse since you will have lost your income and may owe even more to the government (depending on your state, it may be up to 50% of the remaining amount).  There are ways to work with some student debt loans to defer or adjust payments.  There is no such option with a 401k plan. This may change your taxes at the end of the year.  Most people can deduct student loan interest payments.  You cannot deduct interest paid to your 401k loan.  You are paying the interest to yourself though.   It may hurt your long term growth potential.  Currently loans on 401k loans are in the 4% range.  If you are able to make more than 4% inside of your 401k, you will be losing out on that growth since that money will only be earning the interest you pay back. It may limit flexibility for a few years.  When people fall on hard times, their 401k is their last resort.  Some plans have a limit on the number of loans you can have at one time.  You may need a loan or a withdrawal in the future.  Once you take the money out for a loan, you can't access it again.  See the first bullet about working with student loan vendors, they typically have ways to work with you under hard circumstances.  401k loans don't. Amortization schedule.  Many 401k loans can only be amortized for a max of 5 years, if you currently have 10 year loans, can you afford to pay the same debt back in 1/2 the time at a lower rate?  You will have to do the math. When considering debt other than student loans (such as credit cards), if you fall on hard times, you can always negotiate to reduce the amount you owe, or the debt can be discharged (with tax penalties of course).  They can't make you take money out.  Once it is out, it is fair game. Just to clarify, the above isn't saying you shouldn't do it under any circumstances, it is a few things you need to evaluate before making that choice.  The 401k is supposed to be used to help secure your financial future when you can't work.  The numbers may work out in the short term, but do they still work out in the long term?  Most credit cards require minimum payments high enough to pay back in 7-10 years, so does shortening that to 5 (or less) make up for the (probably early) years of compounding interest for your retirement?  I think others have addressed some of this so I won't do the math. I can tell you that I have a 401k loan, and when things got iffy at my job for, it was a very bad feeling to have that over my head because, unlike other debts, there isn't much you can do about it.",Fake,Real,0.9652332067489624,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

For basic planning purposes you can probably figure to spend as much as you are now, maybe a little more.  And adjust as needed when you get there.  (And adjust if, for example, you're moving from a very low cost of living area or to a very high cost of living area.) The cost of housing varies quite a bit from city to city, but you can do this research using Zillow, Craigslist, other places. Now, on to moving itself.  The cost of moving can vary hugely depending on how much stuff you have and how much work you want to do.  On the cheap end, you can rent a U-Haul or one of those portable boxes that they plant outside your old house and move for you.  You'll do all the packing/loading/unloading/unpacking yourself but it saves quite a bit of money.  My family and I moved from Seattle to California last year using one of those portable box places and it ended up costing us ~$1400 including 30 days of storage at the destination while we looked for a place.  We have a <1000 sq foot place with some furniture but not a huge amount and did all the packing/loading ourselves.  If we had wanted full service where people come pack, load, unpack, etc, it could have been 2-3x that amount.  (And if we had more stuff, it could have been a lot more expensive too.  Try not to acquire too much stuff as you just end up having to move it around and take care of it all!)  Your employer may cover moving expenses, ask about this when talking about job offers.  Un-reimbursed moving expenses are tax-deductible in the US (even if you don't itemize).

3751,77063,How to read DOJI chart pattern correctly?,"Candle stick patterns are generally an indication of possible short term changes in price direction (if a reversal pattern). A doji is such a reversal candle, and should be read as there could be a short term change in the direction of price action. A doji is most effective at peaks or troughs, and the outcome can be a higher probability if occuring during overbought conditions (at the peak) or during oversold conditions (at the trough). So a doji should be used for short term changes in direction and not a total change in the overall trend. Although there could be a doji at the very top of an uptrend or at the very bottom of a downtrend, we wouldn't know it was the change of the trend until price action confirms it.  The definition of an uptrend is higher highs and higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows and lower highs. So an uptrend will not be broken until we have a lower high and confirmed by a lower low, or a lower low confirmed by a lower high. Similarly a downtrend will not be broken until we have a higher low confirmed by a higher high or a higher high followed by a higher low. Another thing to consider is that doji's and other candle stick patters work best when the market is trending, even if they are only short term trends. You should usually wait for confirmation of the change in direction by only taking a long trade if price moves above the high of the doji, or only taking a short trade if price moves below the low of the doji.",Fake,Real,0.99619460105896,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3754,77093,What is the difference between a stop order and a stop limit order?,"An attempt at a simple answer for the normal investor: A normal investor buys stock then later sells that stock. (This is known as ""going long"", as opposed to ""going short"").  For the normal investor, a stop order (of either kind) is only used when selling. A stop-loss sell order (or stop sell) is used to sell your stock when it has fallen too much in price, and you don't want to suffer more losses.  If the stock is at $50, you could enter a stop sell at $40, which means if the stock ever falls to $40 or lower, your stock will be sold at whatever price is available (e.g. $35). A stop-loss limit sell order (or stop limit sell) is the same, except you are also saying ""but don't sell for less than my limit price"".  So you can enter a stop limit sell at $40 with a limit of $39, meaning that if the stock falls to $40, you will then have a limit order in effect to sell the stock at $39 or higher.  Thus your stock will never be sold at $35 or any value below $39, but of course, if the stock falls fast from $40 to $35, your limit sell at $39 will not be done and you will be left still owning the stock (worth at that moment $35, say).",Real,Fake,0.9930949807167052,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0

In the United States that is FDIC protection, or the equivalent for a Credit Union. The second consideration is does it have the level of service you need. For this I mean the location of branches, ATMs, or its online services meet your needs for speed, accuracy, and ability to access or move the money as you need. The rest are then balanced on the extras. For your situation those extras include the ability to make free trades. For other it might be a discount on their mortgage. For others it is free checking.  In your current situation if the first two things are met, and you are using those extra benefits then don't change. For me the free trades wouldn't be a benefit, so any major degradation in the safety and service would cause me to leave. Keep in mind that free services exist to entice you to make a deposit: which they can then make money by lending it out; or they offer a free service to entice you to use a service they can charge you to use. All Free services come with a cost. I earned a completely paltry $3.33 YTD over the last 9 months on my   savings at my bank presumably in exchange for these ""free"" trades.

This is your safest option but it will not give you a lot of returns. But  I can guarantee that you will not lose your capital(Unless the economy fails as a whole, which is unlikely).  For example: - you have 500000 rupees. If you put it in a fixed deposit for 1 year, you earn 46500 in interest(At 9% compounded quarterly). With this interest you can invest Rs.3875(46500/12) every month in an SIP for 12 months and also renew your FD, so that you can keep earning that interest.So at the end of 10 years, you will have 5 lacs in your FD and Rs. 4,18,500 in your SIP(Good funds usually make 13-16 % a year). Assuming your fund gives you 14%, you make: -  1.) 46500 at 14% for 9 years - 1,51,215 2.)8 years - 1,32,645 3.) 7 years - 1,16,355 4.) 6 years - 1,02,066 5.) 5 years - 89,531 6.) 4 years - 78,536 7.) 3 years - 68891 8.) 2 years 60,431 9.) 1 year - 53010 Total Maturity Value on SIP = Rs, 8,52,680 Principal on FD =      Rs 5,00,000 Interest earned on 10th year = Rs. 46,500 Total = Rs. 13,99,180(14 lacs).

3764,77149,How to start buying shares with small amount of money?,"Before anything else, read up on the basics of economics. After that, there a few things you need to ask yourself before you even think about investing in anything: If you have an answer to those questions: Once you answered those questions I could make a simple first suggestion: Confident in handling it yourself and low maintenance with uncertain horizon: look up an online bank that offers ETFs such as IWDA (accumulation (dividend is not payed but reinvested) or income(dividend is payed out)) and maybe a few more specific ones then buy and hold for at least 5 years. Confident and high maintenance with long horizon: maybe stock picking but you'll probably never be able to beat the market unless you invest 10's of hours in research per week. However this will also cost a bit and given your initial amount not advisable to do. Be sure that you also have a VERY close look at the prospectus of an investment (especially if you go with a (retail) bank and they ""recommend"" you certain actively traded funds). They tend to charge you quite a bit (yearly management fees of 2-3% (which is A LOT if you are eying maybe 7%-8% yearly) aren't unheard of). ETF's such IWDA only have for example a yearly cost of 0.20%. Personally I have one portfolio (of many) only consisting of that ETF (so IWDA) and one global small cap. It's one of the best and most consistant ones to date. In the end, the amount you start with doesn't really matter so much as long as it's enough to buy at least a few shares of what you have in mind. If you can then increase your portfolio over time and keep the expenses in check, compounding interest should do the rest.",Fake,Real,0.6378718614578247,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3771,77243,What benefits do “title search companies” have over physically visiting a land records offices?,"Basically what @littleadv said, but let me amplify what I think is the most important point. As he/she says, one thing you're paying them for is their expertise. If the title on record at the county office had a legal flaw in it, would you recognize it? In a way your question is like asking, Why should I go to a doctor when I could just make my own medicine out of herbs I grow in my garden and treat myself? Maybe you could. But the doctor and the pharmacist have years of training on how to do this right. You probably don't. Is it possible for you to learn everything you need to do it right? Sure. But do you want to spend the time to study all that for something that you will do -- buy a house -- maybe once every ten years? Will you remember it all next time or have to learn it all over? But really most important is, title companies offer insurance in case the title turns out to be flawed. That, to me, is the big reason why I would use a title company even if I was paying cash and there was no bank involved to insist on it. If there's some legal flaw in the title and it turns out that someone else has a claim to my house, and I lose in court, I would be out about $100,000. Your house might be costing you much more. That's a huge risk to take. Paying the couple of hundred dollars for insurance against that risk seems well worth it to me. And by the way, I don't think the ""due diligence"" is easy. It's NOT just a matter of making sure a title is really on file at the court house and has the proper stamp on it. It's all about, Does someone else have a legal claim to this property? Like, maybe three owners ago someone forged a signature on a deed, so the sale is fraudulent, and now the person who was defrauded or his heirs discover the issue and claim the property. Or maybe the previous owner failed to pay a contractor who did repairs on the house, and now he goes to court and gets a lien on the property. It's unlikely that you have the expertise to recognize a forged document. You almost surely have no way to recognize a forged signature of someone you never met on an otherwise valid-looking document. And you'd have to do a lot of research to find every contractor who ever worked on the house and insure none of them have a claim. Etc.",Fake,Real,0.9576128125190736,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3782,77362,Are multiple hard inquiries for a specific loan type okay?,"tl;dr: Your best course of action is probably to do a soft pull (check your own credit) and provide that to the lender for an unofficial pre-approval to get the ball rolling. The long of it: The loan officer is mostly correct, and I have recent personal evidence that corroborates that. A few months ago I looked into refinancing a mortgage on a rental property, and I allowed 3 different lenders to do a hard inquiry within 1 week of each other. I saw all 3 inquires appear on reports from each of the 3 credit bureaus (EQ/TU/EX), but it was only counted as a single inquiry in my score factors. But as you have suggested, this breaks down when you know that you won't be purchasing right away, because then you will have multiple hard inquiries at least a few months apart which could possibly have a (minor) negative impact on your score. However minor it is, you might as well try to avoid it if you can. I have played around with the simulator on myfico.com, and have found inquiries to have the following effect on your credit score using the FICO Score 8 model: With one inquiry, your scores will adjust as such: Two inquiries: Three inquiries: Here's a helpful quote from the simulator notes: ""Credit inquiries remain on your credit report for 2 years, but FICO Scores only consider credit inquiries from the past 12 months."" Of course, take that with a grain of salt, as myfico provides the following disclaimer: The Simulator is provided for informational purposes only and should not be expected to provide accurate predictions in all situations. Consequently, we make no promise or guarantee with regard to the Simulator. Having said all that, in your situation, if you know with certainty that you will not be purchasing right away, then I would recommend doing a soft pull to get your scores now (check your credit yourself), and see if the lender will use those numbers to estimate your pre-approval. One possible downside of this is the lender may not be able to give you an official pre-approval letter based on your soft pull. I wouldn't worry too much about that though since if you are suddenly ready to purchase you could just tell them to go ahead with the hard pull so they can furnish an official pre-approval letter. Interesting Side Note: Last month I applied for a new mortgage and my score was about 40 points lower than it was 3 months ago. At first I thought this was due to my recent refinancing of property and the credit inquiries that came along with it, but then I noticed that one of my business credit cards had recently accrued a high balance. It just so happens that this particular business CC reports to my personal credit report (most likely in error but I never bothered to do anything about it). I immediately paid that CC off in full, and checked my credit 20 days later after it had reported, and my score shot back up by over 30 points. I called my lender and instructed them to re-pull my credit (hard inquiry), which they did, and this pushed me back up into the best mortgage rate category. Yes, I purposely requested another hard pull, but it shouldn't affect my score since it was within 45 days, and that maneuver will save me thousands in the long run.",Fake,Real,0.9595736265182496,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Assuming you are not operating as an incorporated business, you would need to declare the freelancing income on both your federal and provincial tax returns.  You should be able to deduct certain costs related to your business – for instance, if you paid for software, hosting, domain name registration, etc.  That is, only the profit from your business would be subject to income tax.  With income and expenses arising from self-employment, you may want to use a professional to file your taxes. On the sales taxes: You may also need to charge federal GST and provincial QST (Quebec Sales Tax) on your services:  You must enroll and charge GST and QST once you exceed the ""small supplier"" revenue threshold of $30,000 measured over four consecutive quarters.  (You can still choose to enroll for GST/QST before you reach that amount, but over that amount enrollment becomes mandatory.  Some businesses enroll before the threshold is reached so they can claim input tax credits for tax paid on expenses, but then there's more paperwork – one reason to perhaps avoid enrolling until necessary.) In Quebec, the Ministère du Revenu du Québec administers both GST (on behalf of the federal government) as well as provincial QST.

3791,77462,What is the difference between a stock and a bond?,"In a sentence, stocks are a share of equity in the company, while bonds are a share of credit to the company. When you buy one share of stock, you own a (typically infinitesimal) percentage of the company. You are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company, and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company. A particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends, which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders (the other way is simply by increasing the company's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors). A stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business; you may hear about companies buying 20% or 30% ""interests"" in other companies; they own that percentage of the company, and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool. Typically, a company offers two levels of stocks: ""Common"" stock usually has voting rights attached, and may pay dividends. ""Preferred"" stock usually gives up the voting rights, but pays a higher dividend percentage (maybe double or triple that of common stock) and may have payment guarantees (if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next, the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny). Governments and non-profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity; if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders, while non-profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends. Bonds, on the other hand, are a slice of the company's debt load. Think of bonds as kind of like a corporate credit card. When a company needs a lot of cash, it will sell bonds. A single bond may be worth $10, $100, or $1000, depending on the investor market being targeted. This is the amount the company will pay the bondholder at the end of the term of the bond. These bonds are bought by investors on the open market for less than their face value, and the company uses the cash it raises for whatever purpose it wants, before paying off the bondholders at term's end (usually by paying each bond at face value using money from a new package of bonds, in effect ""rolling over"" the debt to the next cycle, similar to you carrying a balance on your credit card). The difference between the cost and payoff is the ""interest charge"" on this slice of the loan, and can be expressed as a percentage of the purchase price over the remaining term of the bond, as its ""yield"" or ""APY"". For example, a bond worth $100 that was sold on Jan 1 for $85 and is due to be paid on Dec 31 of the same year has an APY of (15/85*100) = 17.65%. Typically, yields for highly-rated companies are more like 4-6%; a bond that would yield 17% is very risky and indicates a very low bond rating, so-called ""junk status"".",Fake,Real,0.8205527663230896,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3794,77499,SEP-IRA doing 1099 work on the side of a W2 employee job,"The limit on SEP IRA is 25%, not 20%.  If you're self-employed (filing on Schedule C), then it's taken on net earning, which in your example would be 25% of $90,000. (https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) JoeTaxpayer is correct as regards the 401(k) limits.  The elective deferrals are per person - That's a cap in sum across multiple plans and across both traditional and Roth if you have those.  In general, it's actually across other retirement plan types too - See below. If you're self-employed and set-up a 401(k) for your own business, the elective deferral is still aggregated with any other 401(k) plans in which you participate that year, but you can still make the employer contribution on your own plan. This IRS page is current a pretty good one on this topic:  https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/one-participant-401k-plans Key quotes that are relevant: The business owner wears two hats in a 401(k) plan: employee and employer. Contributions can be made to the plan in both capacities. The owner can contribute both: •Elective deferrals up to 100% of compensation (“earned income” in the case of a self-employed individual) up to the annual contribution limit:  ◦$18,000 in 2015 and 2016, or $24,000 in 2015 and 2016 if age 50 or over; plus •Employer nonelective contributions up to:  ◦25% of compensation as defined by the plan, or ◦for self-employed individuals, see discussion below It continues with this example: The amount you can defer (including pre-tax and Roth contributions) to all your plans (not including 457(b) plans) is $18,000 in 2015 and 2016. Although a plan's terms may place lower limits on contributions, the total amount allowed under the tax law doesn’t depend on how many plans you belong to or who sponsors those plans. EXAMPLE Ben, age 51, earned $50,000 in W-2 wages from his S Corporation in 2015. He deferred $18,000 in regular elective deferrals plus $6,000 in catch-up contributions to the 401(k) plan. His business contributed 25% of his compensation to the plan, $12,500. Total contributions to the plan for 2015 were $36,500. This is the maximum that can be contributed to the plan for Ben for 2015. A business owner who is also employed by a second company and participating in its 401(k) plan should bear in mind that his limits on elective deferrals are by person, not by plan. He must consider the limit for all elective deferrals he makes during a year. Notice in the example that Ben contributed more that than his elective limit in total (his was $24,000 in the example because he was old enough for the $6,000 catch-up in addition to the $18,000 that applies to everyone else).  He did this by declaring an employer contribution of $12,500, which was limited by his compensation but not by any of his elective contributions. Beyond the 401(k), keep in mind that elective contributions are capped across different types of retirement plans as well, so if you have a SEP IRA and a solo 401(k), your total contributions across those plans are also capped.  That's also mentioned in the example. Now to the extent that you're considering different types of plans, that's a whole question in itself - One that might be worth consulting a dedicated tax advisor.  A few things to consider (not extensive list): As for payroll / self-employment tax: Looks like you will end up paying Medicare, including the new ""Additional Medicare"" tax that came with the ACA, but not SS: If you have wages, as well as self-employment   earnings, the tax on your wages is paid first.   But this rule only applies if your total earnings   are more than $118,500. For example, if you   will have $30,000 in wages and $40,000 in selfemployment   income in 2016, you will pay the   appropriate Social Security taxes on both your   wages and business earnings. In 2016, however,   if your wages are $78,000, and you have $40,700   in net earnings from a business, you don’t pay   dual Social Security taxes on earnings more   than $118,500. Your employer will withhold   7.65 percent in Social Security and Medicare   taxes on your $78,000 in earnings. You must   pay 15.3 percent in Social Security and Medicare   taxes on your first $40,500 in self-employment   earnings and 2.9 percent in Medicare tax on the   remaining $200 in net earnings. https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10022.pdf Other good IRS resources:",Fake,Real,0.9104331135749816,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

If you only fly BA - their club charges ridiculous amounts for taxes and you would probably want to be in one of their partners' clubs. Depending on your traveling pattern - I'd suggest American Airlines (if you travel a lot in the US) or Qantas (if you travel to far East). I'm not familiar with other partners' clubs, so can't tell.

It is possible to make trades with a brokerage firm such that the firm pays if the trader wins the bet.  The firm will typically find parties on the other side to even out this bet and leave itself neutral as to the outcome (plus a small premium it charges each side for the cost of making the market).  The cost charged to one contracting party should be set by the dealer in relation to prices being charged to parties making the opposite, matching bet (in this way, brokers are following market price, while traders are setting it).

3809,77648,What is a good way to save money on car expenses?,"These cars are generally considered out of date and are less prone to be victims of car theft while being reasonably safe. Make sure you pick a model with a good reliability reputation, see what comes up at your local junk yard (the common old models have survived long enough to not end up there until now). Servicing your car takes some effort and some initial investments, but learning how to fix simple problems by yourself will save you a lot of money in the long run. Start by learning how to locate some simple faults. Diagnosing issues is a very costly process if done professionally, but some you may be able to find by yourself. All cars sold in USA from 1996 are required to have this connection below the steering rack. As a consequence most cars manufactured 1995 will have this connector world wide. If you connect your OBD2 adapter to this port your car will be able to tell you what's wrong through an app on your phone and you will be able to clear fault codes by yourself to make sure the problem really is solved. This is what you mechanic should use when servicing your car. While a new print can be expensive you can find used manuals getting thrown out of service centers or at yard sales. These will include service notes and sometimes had-written notes to help you out. The majority of parts on scrapped cars are still in working condition and may not ever see significant wear and tear. If you put some time into removing the part yourself you will have a good idea of how difficult it is to replace the part on your car and outsource the work to a professional if needed. This of course assumes you bring good parts. The main income should come from the work performed on your car, not the markup of spare parts. Generally speaking specialized mechanics working with one or few brands of cars are preferable as these will not only be familiar with your car but are also more likely to get original spare parts (not ""pirate"" parts made to be compatible at a cheaper price). This will make sure the part works as intended and not cause wear and tear of other parts. For example you'd much rather replace a broken fuse instead of cleaning up the aftermath of fried electronics. Turn off the AC when it's not needed. There should be a button labeled ""ECON"" or similar which will disable the AC compressor while keeping the rest of the systems running. The compressor is usually driven by a belt from the crankshaft and will eat up some of the power your engine produces. Just remember that while it saves gas, uncomfortable driving conditions may shorten your patience and reduces your attention. Accelerate up to speed quickly. Contrary to popular belief, this saves more gas than accelerating slowly because the time your engine is under increased load is shorter combined with higher efficiency at medium engine speeds. Allow your speed to decline on uphills, you will regain that speed once the road levels out. Unless you're in heavy traffic driving a bit slower shouldn't harm the flow. Don't let go of the gas pedal, just avoid compensating as much. Your target should be to not lose more than 20% of your speed over the entire ascent and have a constant deceleration or you will start interfering with traffic. Make sure your car is healthy. As obvious as it may sound, worn out parts may harm your mileage. Increased friction in bearings due to broken protective covers or reduced pressure from a broken exhaust are just examples if things that will ruin the efficiency of you driveline. By themselves they may not do much but they add up into both gas consumption and reliability issues. Really do read your owners manual. Nobody knows your car better than the people who built it. What's best for my car may not be best for your car and the best way to make sure your car is working as intended is to take an afternoon with your manual and a cup of your favorite beverage. Afterwards you will know how all the features of your car works. ""Take care of your car and it takes care of you"" is the principle I'm working with. A car you're happy with will make you more calm behind the wheel and leads to higher quality of your driving decisions.

People can read this chart either from the top and go down or from the bottom and go up. Wikipedia does have articles on Top-down and bottom-up design if you want more detail than I give here. Top down refers to the idea of starting at a high level and then working down to get into the details. For example, in planning a vacation, one could start with what continent to go, then which country, then which cities in that country and so forth. Thus, the idea here would be to start with macroeconomic trends and then create a strategy to fix this as the other way is what created the problem. The idea of taking a subject or system and breaking it down into individual pieces would be another way to state this. Bottom up refers to the idea of starting with the details and then build up to get a general idea. To use the vacation example again, this is starting with the cities and then building up to build the overall itinerary. Within political circles you may here of ""grassroots"" efforts where citizens will form groups to gain influence. This would be an example of bottom up since it is starting with the people.

3820,77744,What will be the long term impact of the newly defined minimum exchange rate target from francs to euro?,"The Swiss franc has appreciated quite a bit recently against the Euro as the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to print money to buy government bonds issues by Greek, Portugal, Spain and now Italy.  Some euro holders have flocked to the Swiss franc in an effort to preserve the savings from the massive Euro money printing.  This has increased the value of the Swiss franc.  In response, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has tried to intervene multiple times in the currency market to keep the value of the Swiss franc low.  It does this by printing Swiss francs and using the newly printed francs to buy Euros.  The SNB interventions have failed to suppress the Swiss franc and its value has continued to rise.  The SNB has finally said they will print whatever it takes to maintain a desired peg to the Euro.  This had the desired effect of driving down the value of the franc. Which effect will this have long term for the euro zone? It is now clear that all major central bankers are in a currency devaluation war in which they are all trying to outprint each other.  The SNB was the last central bank to join the printing party.  I think this will lead to major inflation in all currencies as we have not seen the end of money printing.  Will this worsen the European financial crisis or is this not an important factor? I'm not sure this will have much affect on the ongoing European crisis since most of the European government debt is in euros. Should this announcement trigger any actions from common European people concerning their wealth? If a European is concerned with preserving their wealth I would think they would begin to start diverting some of their savings into a harder currency.  Europeans have experienced rapidly depreciating currencies more than people on any other continent.

The AMT can throw everything else out the window.  If a person has a very simple tax situation: Income doesn't change a lot from paycheck to paycheck; they take the standard deduction; the number of exemptions equals the number of people in the family.

3825,77826,Am I exposed to currency risk when I invest in shares of a foreign company that are listed domestically?,"Yes, you're still exposed to currency risk when you purchase the stock on company B's exchange. I'm assuming you're buying the shares on B's stock exchange through an ADR, GDR, or similar instrument. The risk occurs as a result of the process through which the ADR is created. In its simplest form, the process works like this: I'll illustrate this with an example. I've separated the conversion rate into the exchange rate and a generic ""ADR conversion rate"" which includes all other factors the bank takes into account when deciding how many ADR shares to sell. The fact that the units line up is a nice check to make sure the calculation is logically correct. My example starts with these assumptions: I made up the generic ADR conversion rate; it will remain constant throughout this example. This is the simplified version of the calculation of the ADR share price from the European share price:  Let's assume that the euro appreciates against the US dollar, and is now worth 1.4 USD (this is a major appreciation, but it makes a good example):  The currency appreciation alone raised the share price of the ADR, even though the price of the share on the European exchange was unchanged. Now let's look at what happens if the euro appreciates further to 1.5 USD/EUR, but the company's share price on the European exchange falls:  Even though the euro appreciated, the decline in the share price on the European exchange offset the currency risk in this case, leaving the ADR's share price on the US exchange unchanged. Finally, what happens if the euro experiences a major depreciation and the company's share price decreases significantly in the European market? This is a realistic situation that has occurred several times during the European sovereign debt crisis.   Assuming this occurred immediately after the first example, European shareholders in the company experienced a (43.50 - 50) / 50 = -13% return, but American holders of the ADR experienced a (15.95 - 21.5093) / 21.5093 = -25.9% return. The currency shock was the primary cause of this magnified loss.  Another point to keep in mind is that the foreign company itself may be exposed to currency risk if it conducts a lot of business in market with different currencies. Ideally the company has hedged against this, but if you invest in a foreign company through an ADR (or a GDR or another similar instrument), you may take on whatever risk the company hasn't hedged in addition to the currency risk that's present in the ADR/GDR conversion process. Here are a few articles that discuss currency risk specifically in the context of ADR's: (1), (2). Nestle, a Swiss company that is traded on US exchanges through an ADR, even addresses this issue in their FAQ for investors. There are other risks associated with instruments like ADR's and cross-listed companies, but normally arbitrageurs will remove these discontinuities quickly. Especially for cross-listed companies, this should keep the prices of highly liquid securities relatively synchronized.",Real,Fake,0.8652295470237732,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0
3826,77831,How do I set up my finances when first moving out?,"The first thing you need to do is to set yourself a budget. Total all your money coming in (from jobs, allowances, etc.) and all your money going out (including rent, utilities, loan repayments, food, other essential and the luxuries).  If your money coming in is more than your money going out, then you are onto a positive start. If on the other hand your money going out is more than the money coming in, then you are at the beginning of big trouble. You will have to do at least one of 2 things, either increase your income or reduce your expenses or both. You will have to go through all your expenses (money going out) and cut back on the luxuries, try to get cheaper alternatives for some of your essential, and get a second job or increase your hours at your current job. The aim is to always have more money coming in than the money you spend. The second thing to do is to pay off any outstanding debts by paying more than the minimum amounts and then have some savings goals. You said you wanted to save for a car - that is one saving goal. Another saving goal could be to set up a 6 month emergency fund (enough money in a separate account to be able to survive at least 6 months in case something happened, such as you lost your job or you suddenly got sick). Next you could look at getting a higher education so you can go out and get higher paying jobs. When you do get a higher paying job, the secret is not to spend all your extra money coming in on luxuries, you should treat yourself but do not go overboard. Increase the amounts you save and learn how to invest so you can get your savings to work harder for you. Building a sound financial future for yourself takes a lot of hard work and discipline, but once you do get started and change the way you do things you will find that it doesn't take long for things to start getting easier.

3828,77861,Looking for advice on rental property,"You say that one property is 65% of the value of the two properties and the other is 35%.  But how much of that do the two of you actually own?  If you have co-signed mortgages on both properties, then your equity is going to be lower.  If you sold both properties, then your take away would be just half of that equity.  And while the 35% property may be less valuable, if you bought it first, it may actually have more equity.   It's the equity that matters here, not the value of the property.  With a mortgage, the bank is more of an owner than you are until you've paid down most of the loan.   You may find that the bank won't agree to a single-owner refinance.  A co-signed mortgage is a lot easier for them to collect, as they can hold either of you responsible for the entire loan.   If you sell the 65% property, then you can pay off any mortgage on that property and use the equity payout from that to buy out your relative on the 35% property.  If you currently have no mortgage, you'd even have cash back.  This is your fewest strings option.   Let's say that you have no mortgage now.  So this mortgage would be the only mortgage on the property.  It's not so much, as 15:65 is 3:13 or 18.75% of the value of the property.  That's more of a home equity loan than a mortgage.  You should be able to get a good rate.  It might reduce your short term profit, but it should be survivable if you have other income.   If you don't have other income, then seriously consider selling the 65% property and diversifying the payout into something else.  E.g. stocks and bonds.   Perhaps your relative would be willing to float you the loan.  That would save you bank fees and closing costs.  Write up a contract and agree to take assignment of the title at payoff.  You'll need to pay a lawyer to write up the contract (paying a modest amount now to cover the various future possibilities), but that should still be cheaper.   There's a certain amount of trust required on both sides, but this gives you some separation.  And of course it takes your relative out of the day-to-day management entirely.  Perhaps the steady flow of cash would provide what they need.   If your relative is willing to remain that involved, that can work.  Note that they may not want to do this, so don't get too attached to the idea.  Be prepared for a no.  This would be a great option for you, as you pretty much get everything you have now.  They get back the time meeting with you to make decisions, but they also give up control over those decisions.  Some people would not like that tradeoff.   The one time I was involved with a professional managing a property for me, the fee was around 7% of the rent.  If that fits your area, you might reasonably charge 5%.  That gives a discount for family and not being a professional.   There's a relatively easy way to find out what fits your area.  Look around and see what companies offer multiple listings.  Call until you find a couple that will do management for you.  Get quotes for managing your properties.  Now you'll know the amounts.   The big failing though is that this may not describe the issue that your relative has.  If the real problem is that the two of you have different approaches to property management, then making you the only decision maker may be the wrong direction.  This is certainly financially feasible, but it still may not be the right solution for your relationship.   If you get a no on this, I'd recommend moving on to other solutions immediately.  This may simply be too favorable to you.",Fake,Real,0.9250078797340392,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

It's not clear if the idea is that you are paying them all the money up front or will be making payments over time, but either way if they don't clear the lien with the bank then the bank can come after the car no matter who is in physical possession of it. That would leave you without either the money or the car.

At the time of writing this, 1 U.S. Dollar = 64 Indian Rupees. Consider the following economic factors: Both of the above factors are not definitive but are worth considering. You might be thinking- what if I never intend to convert my rupees back to dollars? If it is the case that money converted to rupees would stay that way, that then eliminates the risk of foreign exchange losses mentioned above. However, you must still keep in mind that part of the reason interest rates on fixed deposits is as high in India is because inflation is high. A 9% return must be looked at after adjusting for inflation. Inflation is somewhere between 5%-6% at the time of writing which then reduces your real return to about 4% (pre-tax).",Fake,Real,0.5087079405784607,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

3851,78110,Best personal finance strategy to control my balance,"I started storing and summing all my receipts, bills, etc. It has the advantage of letting me separate expenses by category, but it's messy and it takes a long time.  It sounds from this like you are making your summaries far too detailed. Don't. Instead, start by painting with broad strokes. For example, if you spent $65.17 at the grocery store, don't bother splitting that amount into categories like toiletries, hygiene products, food, and snacks: just categorize it as ""grocery spending"" and move on to the next line on your account statement. Similarly, unless your finances are heavily reliant on cash, don't worry about categorizing each cash expense; rather, just categorize the withdrawal of cash as miscellaneous and don't spend time trying to figure out exactly where the money went after that. Because honestly, you probably spent it on something other than savings. Because really, when you are just starting out getting a handle on your spending, you don't need all the nitty-gritty details. What you need, rather, is an idea of where your money is going. Figure out half a dozen or so categories which make sense for you to categorize your spending into (you probably have some idea of where your money is going). These could be loans, cost of living (mortgage/rent, utilities, housing, home insurance, ...), groceries, transportation (car payments, fuel, vehicle taxes, ...), savings, and so on -- whatever fits your situation. Add a miscellaneous category for anything that doesn't neatly fit into one of the categories you thought of. Go back something like 3-4 months among your account statements, do a quick categorization for each line on your account statements into one of these categories, and then sum them up per category and per month. Calculate the monthly average for each category. That's your starting point: the budget you've been living by (intentionally or not). After that, you can decide how you want to allocate the money, and perhaps dig a bit more deeply into some specific category. Turns out you are spending a lot of money on transportation which you didn't expect? Look more closely at those line items and see if there's something you can cut. Are you spending more money at the grocery store than you thought? Then look more closely at that. And so on. Once you know where you are and where you want to be (such as for example bumping the savings category by $200 per month), you can adjust your budget to take you closer to your goals. Chances are you won't realistically be able to do an about-face turn on the spot, but you can try to reduce some discretionary category by, say, 10% each month, and transfer that into savings instead. That way, in 6-7 months, you have cut that category in half.",Fake,Real,0.9998220801353456,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3854,78125,Ensuring payment from client,"You should absolutely have a contract between you and your client stipulating the quid-pro-quos of the arrangement. They get the product, you get the money. First off, this contract should specify what you must do, and what they must do, for the contract to be ""satisfied"". This isn't necessarily just product for money; your client may be under deadlines to approve the product in various stages of work in process. Depending on the product, the client may be required to provide starting materials (like existing logos/slogans for advertising/marketing graphics), information on or access to computer systems (for software or infrastructure consulting, or accounting auditing), etc. Second, if you provide a tangible product like graphics or software, the contract should clearly state that ""intellectual property transfers on satisfaction of contract""; they don't own what you have made until they have accepted it and paid you accordingly. If they try to stiff you by taking what you made them and using it before you've been paid, you can take them to the cleaner's for copyright violations. Third, you should structure a payment schedule; don't do too much for free. You can get the money in thirds, for instance; a third up front, a third at some defined halfway point and a third on final delivery and acceptance. Lastly, you should stipulate that the client is responsible for all expenses incurred by you as a result of their failure to pay as stipulated, up to and including attorney's fees. Definitely have a lawyer draft these agreements; contract law is a many-layered area of law with hundreds of years of case law and slightly different nuances in every state. A competent lawyer will know things that can and can't be stipulated in a contract, and if you try to do it alone you'll wish you hadn't when the contract's tossed out by a judge because of some technicality. If they refuse to pay, get the lawyer on the phone and file suit. A well-written contract drafted by a competent lawyer, which you have lived up to on your end, will give your client no loopholes to slip through. As far as recovering damages, it shouldn't matter whether he's in the U.S. or not; if he does business in the U.S. then he very probably has money in banks that have to listen to U.S. courts (or at least court orders).",Fake,Real,0.9783815145492554,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3858,78185,Are there any disadvantages of Progress Draw Mortgage?,"Presumably, the inverse of the advantages? You are guaranteed the interest rate that is written on your mortgage commitment as long as the first draw happens before the rate hold expiry date (typically 120 days from application date). In most cases, it takes at least 6 months or more to build a home from the ground up. That means that you are taking a chance at what the interest rates and qualifying criteria will be several months down the road. You can normally only lock in 120 days prior to possession with a 'Completion Mortgage'. Lenders are constantly changing their guidelines and rates are predicted to increase over the coming months. That means you are much better to obtain draw mortgage financing to avoid any of these uncertainties. You will know that you have your financing in place right away before construction even starts. This is a huge peace of mind so you can relax and get ready for the big move. So thus, if interest rates are lower 6 months or a year from now, that'd be the disadvantage -- a longer lock-in period.",Fake,Real,0.6680091619491577,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

3860,78234,How do share dilution scams make money?,"For this to work, those who control the dilution must also control their salaries because the only way for them to be paid off when it's the corporation itself selling is to gain access to the proceeds. When a corporation sells newly issued equity, the corporation itself owns the money.  To at least have the appearance of propriety, the scammers must be paid those proceeds.  Both actions imply that the board is captured by the scammers. There are many corporations that seem to do this even with persistently large market capitalizations. The key difference between this and pump-and-dump is that its a fraudulent group of investors selling in this case instead of the corporation itself. A detailed simple example Corporations are mandated by law to be little oligarchies; although, ""republic"" is now becoming more appropriate with all of the new shareholder rights.  A corporation is controlled at root by the board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.  The board has no direct operational control, as that is left to the ""king"", the CEO; however, the board does control what everyone wants access to: the money. Board members have all sorts of legal qualitative mandates on how to behave, and they've functioned fairly decently efficiently over the long run, but there are definitely some bad apples. Boards are somewhat intransigent since it's difficult to hold board elections, and usually only specific board members are put up for election by a shareholder vote, so a bad one has the potential to really get stuck in there.  Once a bad one is in there, they don't care because they know it will be tough to get them out, so they run roughshod over the company's purse. Only the board can take action on major funding such as the CEO's operating budget, board compensation, financing, investment, etc, some with shareholder approval, some without.  The corporation itself owns all of those assets, but the board controls them. In this example, they scheme with most likely the top executive, but a rubber stamp top executive could allow a lower rung to scheme with the board, but the board is always constant until the law is changed. Because there's no honor amongst thieves, the board votes which can require some combination of executive and shareholder approval are taken very close together: sell shares, increase salaries to key executive schemers, increase board compensation.  The trusting shareholders believe this is in the best interests of the company at large so go along. So the money flows from existing & new shareholders to the corporation now controlled by a malicious board and then finally to the necessary malicious executive and the vital malicious board.",Fake,Real,0.9980835914611816,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3880,78355,What is the best and most optimal way to use margin,"This essentially depends on how you prefer to measure your performance. I will just give a few simple examples to start. Let me know if you're looking for something more. If you just want to achieve maximum $ return, then you should always use maximum margin, so long as your expected return (%) is higher than your cost to borrow. For example, suppose you can use margin to double your investment, and the cost to borrow is 7%. If you're investing in some security that expects to return 10%, then your annual return on an account opened with $100 is: (2 * $100 * 10% - $100 * 7%) / $100 = 13% So, you see the expected return, amount of leverage, and cost to borrow will all factor in to your return. Suppose you want to also account for the additional risk you're incurring. Then you could use the Sharpe Ratio. For example, suppose the same security has volatility of 20%, and the risk free rate is 5%. Then the Sharpe Ratio without leverage is: (10% - 5%) / 20% = 0.25 The Sharpe Ratio using maximum margin is then: (13% - 5%) / (2 * 20%) = 0.2, where the 13% comes from the above formula.

If I exercise early and still have to wait, there may never be a chance I can sell at a profit, and I'll have lost the money I paid to exercise and any tax I had to pay when I exercised."" All of that is true. But if you exercise early: The fair market value of the stock will probably be lower, so you may pay less income tax when you exercise. (This depends on your tax situation. Currently, ISO exercises affect your AMT.) If the company goes through a phase where the value is unusually high, you'll be able to sell and still get the tax benefits because you exercised earlier. You avoid the nightmare scenario where you leave the company (voluntarily or not) and can't afford to exercise your options because of the tax implications. In many realistic cases, exercising earlier means less risk. Imagine if you're working at a company that is privately held and you expect to be there for another year or so. You are very optimistic about the company, but not sure when it will IPO or get acquired and that may be several years off. The fair market value of the stock is low now, but may be much higher in a year. In this case, it makes a lot of sense to exercise now. The cost is low because the fair market value is low so it won't result in a huge tax bill. And then when you leave in a year, you won't have to choose between forfeiting your options or borrowing money to pay the much higher taxes due to exercise them then.",Fake,Real,0.8353856205940247,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Is your Birthday Month/Day/Year.""  That is not sketchy. It would be sketchy for a caller to ask you to give that information; that's a common scheme for identity theft. OSCEOLA are following the rules on this one. My mom suggested I should consider applying for bankruptcy Won't help. Student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy. You have the bankruptcy ""reform"" act passed during the Bush 43 regime for that. The loan itself is from school. What school? Contact them and ask for help. They may have washed their hands of your case when they turned over your file to OSCEOLA. Then again, they may not. It's worth finding out.   Also, name and shame the school. Future applicants should be warned that they will do this.  What can I do to aid in my negotiations with this company? Don't negotiate on the phone. You've discovered that they won't honor such negotiations. Ask for written communications sent by postal mail. Keep copies of everything, including both sides of the canceled checks you use to make payments (during the six months and in the future). Keep making the payments you agreed to in the conversation six months ago. Do not, EVER, ignore a letter from them. Do not, EVER, skip going to court if they send you a summons to appear. They count on people doing this. They can get a default judgement if you don't show up. Then you're well and truly screwed. What do you want? You want the $4K fee removed. If you want something else, figure out  what it is. Here's what to do: Write them a polite letter explaining what you said here. Recount the conversation you had with their telephone agent where they said they would remove the $4K fee if you made payments.  Recount the later conversation. If possible give the dates of both conversations and the names of the both agents.   Explain the situation completely. Don't assume the recipient of your letter knows anything about your case. Include evidence that you made payments as agreed during the six months. If you were late or something, don't withhold that.  Ask them to remove the extra $4K from your account, and ask for whatever else you want. Send the letter to them with a return receipt requested, or even registered mail. That will prevent them from claiming they didn't get it. And it will show them you're serious. Write a cover letter admitting your default, saying you relied on their negotiation to set things straight, and saying you're dismayed they aren't sticking to their word. The cover letter should ask for help sorting this out. Send copies of the letter with the cover letter to: Be sure to mark your letter to OSCEOLA ""cc"" all these folks, so they know you are asking for help. It can't hurt to call your congressional representative's office and ask to whom you should send the letter, and then address it by name. This is called Constituent Service, and they take pride in it. If you send this letter with copies you're letting them know you intend to fight.  The collection agency may decide it's not worth the fight to get the $4K and decide to let it go.   Again, if they call to pressure you, say you'd rather communicate in writing, and that they are not to call you by telephone. Then hang up.  Should I hire a lawyer?  Yes, but only if you get a court summons or if you don't get anywhere with this. You can give the lawyer all this paperwork I've suggested here, and it will help her come up to speed on your case. This is the kind of stuff the lawyer would do for you at well over $100 per hour. Is bankruptcy really an option Certainly not, unfortunately.

3908,78635,"How are people able to spend more than what they make, without going into debt?","If you make $10 in salary, $5 in interest on savings, and $10 in dividends, your income is $25, not $10. If you have a billion dollars in well-invested assets, you can take a loan against those assets and the interest payment on the loan will be smaller than the interest you earn on the assets. That means your investment will grow faster than your debt and you have a net positive gain. It makes no sense to do this if the value of your asset is static. In that case, you would be better off just to withdraw from the asset and spend it directly, since a loan against that static asset will result in you spending your asset plus interest charges. If you have a good enough rate of return on your investment, you may actually be able to do this in perpetuity, taking out loan after loan, making the loan payments from the loan proceeds, while the value of your original asset pool continues to grow. At any given time, though, a severe downturn in the market could potentially leave you with large debts and insufficient value in your assets to back the debt. If that happens, you won't be getting another loan and the merry-go-round will stop spinning. It's a bit of a Ponzi scheme, in a way. The U.S. government has done exactly this for a long time and has gotten away with it because the dollar has been the world's reserve currency. You could always get a loan against the value of the U.S. currency in the past. Those days may be dwindling, with more countries choosing alternative currencies to conduct business with and the dollar becoming comparatively weaker into the foreseeable future. If you have savings, you can spend more than you make, which will put you into debt, then you can draw down your savings to pay that debt, and at the end of the month you will be out of debt, but have less in savings. You cannot do this forever. Eventually, you run out of savings. If you have no savings, you immediately go into debt and stay there when you spend more than you make. This is simple arithmetic. If you have no savings, but you own assets (real estate, securities, a collection of never-opened Beatles vinyl records, a bicycle), then you could spend more than you make, and be in debt, but have the potential to liquidate assets to pay off all or part of the debt. This depends on finding a buyer and negotiating a price that helps you enough to make a real difference. If you have a car, and you owe $10 on it, but you can only find a buyer willing to pay $8 for the car, that doesn't help you unless you can refinance the $2 and your new payment amount is lower than the old payment amount. But then you're still $2 in debt on the car even though you no longer possess it, and you've still increased your debt by spending more than you made. If you stay on this path, sooner or later you will not have any assets left and you will be in debt, plain and simple. As a wrinkle in the concrete example, let's say you have stock options with your employer. This is a form of a ""call."" You could also purchase a call through a broker in the stock market, or for a commodity in the futures market. That means you pay up front for the right to buy a specific amount of an asset at a fixed price (usually with an expiration date). You don't own the stock, you just have the right to buy it at the call price, regardless of the current market value when you buy it. In the case of employee stock options, your upfront cost is in the form of a vesting schedule. You have to remain employed for a set time before a specific number of stocks become eligible for you to purchase at your option price (the stocks ""vest"" on a certain date). Remain employed longer, and more stocks may vest, depending on your contract. If you quit or are terminated before that date, you forfeit your options. If you stick around through your vesting schedule, you pay real money to buy the stock at your option price. It only makes sense to do this if the market value of the stock is higher than your option price. If the current market value is lower than your option price, you're better off just buying the asset at the current market value, or waiting and  hoping that the value increases before your contract expires. You could drive yourself into debt by spending more than you make, but still have a chance to eliminate your debt by exercising your call/option and then re-selling the asset if it is worth more than what you pay for it. But you may have to wait for a vesting period to elapse before you can exercise your option (depending on the nature of your contract). During this waiting period, you are in debt, and if you can't service your debt (i.e. make payments acceptable to your creditors) your things could get repossessed. Oh, don't forget that you'll also pay a brokerage fee to sell the asset after you exercise your option. Further, if you have exhausted your savings and nobody will give you a loan to exercise your stock (or futures) options, then in the end you would be even further in debt because you already paid for the call, but you are unable to capitalize it and you'll lose what you already paid. If you can get a loan to exercise your option, but you're a bad credit risk, chances are good that the lender will draft a contract requiring you to immediately pay back the loan proceeds plus a fee out of the proceeds of re-selling the stock or other asset. In fact the lender might even draft a contract assigning ownership of your options to them, and stipulating that they'll pay you what's left after they subtract their fee. Even if you can get a traditional loan, you will pay interest over time. The end result is that your debt has still cost you very real money beyond the face value of the debt. Finally, if the asset for which you have a call has decreased in value lower than the current market value, you would be better off buying it directly in the market instead of exercising your option. But you'll pay transaction fees to do that, and the entire action would be pure speculation (or ""investment""), but not an immediate means to pay off your debt. Unless you have reliable insider trading information. But then you risk running afoul of the law. Frankly it might be better to get a loan to pay off your debt than to buy an ""investment"" hoping the value will increase, unless you could guarantee that the return on your investment would be bigger than the cumulative interest and late fees on your debt (or the risk of repossession of your belongings). Remember that nothing you owe a debt on is actually yours, not your house, not your car, not your bicycle, not your smartphone. Most of the time, your best course of action is to make minimum payments on your lowest-interest debts and make extra payments on your highest interest debt, up to the highest total payment you can tolerate (set something aside in a rainy day fund just in case). As you pay off the highest-interest debt, shift the amount you were paying on that debt to make extra payments on your next highest-interest debt until that one is paid off, and repeat on down the line until you're out of debt, then live within your means so that you don't find yourself working at McDonald's because you don't have a choice when you're in your 80's.",Real,Fake,0.571604311466217,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0

3916,78718,"For a car, what scams can be plotted with 0% financing vs rebate?","Here's a number-crunching example of how the ""Zero interest rate"" offer is misleading. Suppose the offer is that a car ""costs $24,000.00 with zero percent financing over 24 months""  or as an alternative, ""$3,000.00 off for cash"". Ignore the hype:  the quoted prices and the quoted interest rates.  Look at what really happens to two people who take advantage of the two offers, One person hands over $21,000.00 cash, and leaves with the new car. The second promises to make 24 payments of $1000.00, one a month, starting in one month's time, and also leaves with the same make and model new car. The two people have received exactly the same benefit, so the two payment schemes must have the same value. A mortgage program will tell you that paying off a $21,000.00 loan by making 24 monthly payments of $1000.00 requires an interest rate of 1.10% a month, or an effective annual rate of 14.03%.",Fake,Real,0.5094424486160278,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

3921,78771,Put-Call parity - what is the difference between the two representations?,"Well, the first one is based on the ""Pert"" formula for continuously-compounded present value, while the second one is the periodically-compounded variant.  Typically, the continuously-compounded models represent the ideal; as the compounding period of time-valued money shrinks towards zero, and the discount rate (or interest rate if positive) stays constant over the time period examined, the periodic equation's results approach that of the continuously-compounded equation. Those two assumptions (a constant rate and continuous balance adjustment from interest) that allow simplification to the continuous form are usually incorrect in real-world finance; virtually all financial institutions accrue interest monthly, for a variety of reasons including simpler bookkeeping and less money paid or owed in interest. They also, unless prohibited by contract, accrue this interest based on a rate that can change daily or even more granularly based on what financial markets are doing. Most often, the calculation is periodic based on the ""average daily balance"" and an agreed rate that, if variable, is based on the ""average daily rate"" over the previous observed period. So, you should use the first form for fast calculation of a rough value based on estimated variables. You should use the second form when you have accurate periodic information on the variables involved.

3927,78868,Investment for young expatriate professionals,"That's a broad question, but I can throw some thoughts at you from personal experience.  I'm actually an Australian who has worked in a couple of companies but across multiple countries and I've found out first hand that you have a wealth of opportunities that other people don't have, but you also have a lot of problems that other people won't have. First up, asset classes. Real estate is a popular asset class, but unless you plan on being in each of these countries for a minimum of one to two years, it would be seriously risky to invest in rental residential or commercial real estate. This is because it takes a long time to figure out each country's particular set of laws around real estate, plus it will take a long time to get credit from the local bank institutions and to understand the local markets well enough to select a good location. This leaves you with the classics of stocks and bonds. You can buy stocks and bonds in any country typically. So you could have some stocks in a German company, a bond fund in France and maybe a mutual fund in Japan. This makes for interesting diversification, so if one country tanks, you can potentially be hedged in another. You also get to both benefit and be punished by foreign exchange movements. You might have made a killing on that stock you bought in Tokyo, but it turns out the Yen just fell by 15%. Doh. And to top this off, you are almost certainly going to end up filling out tax returns in each country you have made money in. This can get horribly complicated, very quickly. As a person who has been dealing with the US tax system, I can tell you that this is painful and the US in particular tries to get a cut of your worldwide income. That said, keep in mind each country has different tax rates, so you could potentially benefit from that as well. My advice? Choose one country you suspect you'll spend most of your life in and keep most of your assets there. Make a few purchases in other places, but minimize it. Ultimately most ex-pats move back to their country of origin as friends, family and shared culture bring them home.",Fake,Real,0.9894707202911376,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0
3928,78888,Currency exchange problem,"For the purposes of report generation, I would recommend that you present the data in the currency of the user's home country. You could present another indicator, if needed, to indicate that a specific transaction was denominated in a foreign currency, where the amount represents the value of the foreign-denominated transaction in the user's home country Currency. For example: Airfare from USA to London: $1,000.00 Taxi from airport to hotel: $100.00 (in £) In terms of your database design, I would recommend not storing the data in any one denomination or reference currency. This would require you to do many more conversions between currencies that is likely to be necessary, and will create additional complexity where in some cases, you will need to do multiple conversions per transaction in and out of your reference currency. I think it will be easier for you to store multiple currencies as themselves, and not in a separate reference currency. I would recommend storing several pieces of information separately for each transaction: This way, you can create a calculated Amount for each transaction that is not in the user's ""home"" currency, whereas you would need to calculate this for all transactions if you used a universal reference currency. You could also get data from an external source if the user has forgotten the conversion rate. Remember that there are always fees and variations in the exchange rate that a user will get for their home country's currency, even if they change money at the same place at two different times on the same day. As a result, I would recommend building in a simple form that allows a user to enter how much they exchanged and how much they got back to calculate the exchange rate. So for example, let's say I have $ 200.00 USD and I exchanged $ 100.00 USD for £ 60.00, and there was a £ 3.00 fee for the exchange. The exchange rate would be 0.6, and when the user enters a currency conversion, your site could create three separate transactions such as: USD Converted to £: $100.00 £ Received from Exchange: £ 60.00 Exchange Fee: £ 3.00 So if the user exchanged currency and then ran a balance report by Currency, you could either show them that they now have $ 100.00 USD and £ 57.00, or you could alternatively choose to show the £ 57.00 that they have as $95.00 USD instead. If you were showing them a transaction report, you could also show the fee denominated in dollars as well. I would recommend storing your balances and transactions in their own currencies, as you will run into some very interesting problems otherwise. For example, let's say you used a reference currency tied to the dollar. So one day I exchange $ 100.00 USD for £ 60.00. In this system I would still have 100 of my reference currency. However, if the next day, the exchange rate falls and $ 1.00 USD is only worth £ 0.55, and I change my £ 60.00 back into USD, I will get approxiamately $ 109.09 USD back for my £ 60.00. If I then go and buy something for $ 100.00 USD, the balance of the reference currency would be at 0, but I will still have $ 9.09 USD in my pocket as a result of the fluctuating currency values! That is why I'd recommend storing currencies as themselves, and only showing them in another currency for convenience using calculations done ""on the fly"" at report runtime.

3942,79018,"4 months into a 30 month car loan, need new engine, can't sell any body parts","Without knowing the details of your financial situation, I can only offer general advice.  It might be worth having a financial counselor look at your finances and offer some custom advice.  You might be able to find someone that will do this for free by asking at your local church. I would advise you not to try to get another loan, and certainly not to start charging things to a credit card.  You are correct when you called it a ""nightmare.""  You are currently struggling with your finances, and getting further into debt will not help.  It would only be a very short-term fix and have long-lasting consequences.   What you need to do is look at the income that you have and prioritize your spending.  For example, your list of basic needs includes: If you have other things that you are spending money on, such as medical debt or other old debt that you are trying to pay off, those are not as important as funding your basic needs above. If there is anything you can do to reduce the cost of the basic needs, do it.  For example, finding a cheaper place to live or a place closer to your job might save you money.  Perhaps accepting nutrition assistance from a local food bank or the Salvation Army is an option for you. Now, about your car: Your transportation to your job is very much one of your basic needs, as it will enable you to pay for your other needs.  If you can use public transportation until you can get a working car again, or you can find someone that will give you a ride, that will solve this problem.  If not, you'll need to get a working car. You definitely don't want to take out another loan for a car, as you are already having trouble paying the first loan.  I'm guessing that it will be less expensive to get the engine repaired than it will be to buy a new car at this point.  But that is just a guess.  You'll need to find out how much it will cost to fix the car, and see if you can swing it by perhaps eliminating expenses that aren't necessary, even for a short time.  For example, if you are paying installments on medical debt, you might have to skip a payment to fix your car.  It's not ideal, but if you are short on cash, it is a better option than losing your job or taking out even more debt for your car. Alternatively, buying another, functional car, if it costs less than fixing your current car, is an option.  If you don't have the money to pay your current car loan payments, you'll lose your current car. Just to be clear, many of these options will mess up your credit score.  However, borrowing more, in an attempt to save your credit score, will probably only put off the inevitable, as it will make paying everything off that much harder.  If you don't have enough income to pay your debts, you might be better off to just take the credit score ding, get back on your feet, and then work to eliminate the debt once you've got your basic needs covered. Sorry to hear about your situation.  Again, this advice is just general, and might not all apply to your financial details.

3943,79032,Lease vs buy car with cash?,"A lease is a rental plain and simple.  You borrow money to finance the expected depreciation over the course of the lease term.  This arrangement will almost always cost more over time of your ""ownership.""  That does not mean that a lease is always a worse ""deal.""   Cars are almost always a losing proposition; save for the oddball Porsche or Ferrari that is too scarce relative to demand.  You accept ownership of a car and it starts to lose value.  New cars lose value faster than used cars.  Typically, if you were to purchase the car, then sell it after 3 years, the total cost over those three years will work out to less total money than the equivalent 36 month lease.  But, you will have to come up with a lot more money down, or a higher monthly payment, and/or sell the car after 36 months (assuming the pretty standard 36 month lease).  With this in mind, some cars lease better than others because the projected depreciation is more favorable than other brands or models.   Personally, I bought a slightly used car certified pre-owned with a agreeable factory warranty extension.  My next car I may lease.  Late model cars are getting so unbelievably expensive to maintain that more and more I feel like a long term rental has merit. Just understand that for the convenience, for the freeing up of your cash flow, for the unlikelihood of maintenance, to not bother with resale or trading the car in, a lease will cost a premium over a purchase over the same time frame.",Fake,Real,0.8492584228515625,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0
3944,79045,"Single investment across multiple accounts… good, bad, indifferent?","The other issue you could run into is that each deferred account is going to be subject to its own RMD's (Required Minimum Distributions) when you've retired or hit 70.5 years of age.  Roth's don't generally care about RMD's at first, but are still subject to them once the person that created the Roth has passed.  Having fewer accounts will simplify the RMD stuff, but that's really only a factor in terms of being forced to sell 'something' in each account in order to make the RMD.   Other than that, it's just a matter of remembering to check each account if you come to a decision that it's time to liquidate holdings in a given security, lest you sell some but forget about the rest of it in another account.  (and perhaps as Chris pointed out, maybe having to pay fee's on each account for the sale)  Where this really can come into play is if you choose to load up each individual account with a given kind of investment, instead of spreading them across the accounts.  In that case RMD's could force you into selling something that is currently 'down' when you want to hold onto it, because that is your only choice in order to meet RMD's for account X.  So if you have multiple accounts, it's a good idea to not 'silo' particular vehicles into a single account, but spread similar ivestments across multiple accounts, so you always have the choice in each account of what to sell in order to meet an RMD.

If you want to sell independent of price, then as you begin to flood the market with your shares, the price you get per additional share may decline until it finds a buyer.

Such autodialiers can run off a personal computer via VoIP or some such third-party.  As to getting the numbers, it can be either from a purchased list (if they're serious about this and are obeying any call opt-out lists) or simply a number range dialed sequentially, whether they work or not. In a more serious operation, any returns are fed directly to a call centre where real human beings then initiate direct contact.  Otherwise it is simply a fishing expedition and any valid numbers can then be sold to other agencies as a screened list (and, therefore, more valuable). From an SMS perspective, anyone can purchase a vendor-level SMS Gateway subscription (of which there are loads of vendors - and note the number that allow ""web-to-SMS"") which permits you to receive and respond to any SMS received. This is always about the ""law of large numbers"".  If they can get in the hundreds of thousands of valid numbers and a small number respond then they can make money.

3960,79316,Tax treatment of a boxed trade?,"Here's how capital gains are totaled: Long and Short Term. Capital gains and losses are either long-term or   short-term. It depends on how long the taxpayer holds the property. If   the taxpayer holds it for one year or less, the gain or loss is   short-term. Net Capital Gain.  If a taxpayer’s long-term gains are more than their   long-term losses, the difference between the two is a net long-term   capital gain. If the net long-term capital gain is more than the net   short-term capital loss, the taxpayer has a net capital gain. So your net long-term gains (from all investments, through all brokers) are offset by any net short-term loss.  Short term gains are taxed separately at a higher rate. I'm trying to avoid realizing a long term capital gain, but at the same time trade the stock. If you close in the next year, one of two things will happen - either the stock will go down, and you'll have short-term gains on the short, or the stock will go up, and you'll have short-term losses on the short that will offset the gains on the stock.

If you look at property prices over the past 20 years or so, you can see returns can be very good.  I bought a house in 1998 and sold it in 2003 for about 110% of the purchase price.  Disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future returns! It's a fairly low risk option, property prices appear to be rising currently and it's always good to get your foot on the housing ladder as quickly as you can as prices can rise to the stage where even those earning quite a good salary cannot afford to buy. Of course you don't have to live in the house, a rental income can be very handy without tying you down too much. There are plenty of places in the UK where £60k will buy you a reasonable property with a rental income of £400-£500, it doens't have to be near where you live currently. Just to put a few more figures in - if you get a house for £50k and rent it for £400 a month (perfectly feasible where I live) then that's very close to a 10% return year on year.  Plus any gains made by the price of the house. The main downside is you won't have easy access to the money and you will have to look after a tenant if you decide to rent it out.  Also if you do buy a property make sure it is in a good state of repair, you don't want to have to pay for a new roof for example in a couple of years time. Ideally you would then sell the house around the time property prices peak and buy another when they bottom out again.  Not easy to judge though!

3967,79477,Is there difference in risk between physical or synthetic replication of an index by an ETF?,"First, make sure you understand the objective of an ETF.  In some cases, they may use leverage to get a multiple of the index's return that is different than 1.  Some may be ultra funds that go for double the return or double the inverse of the return and thus will try to apply the appropriate leverage to achieve that return. Those that use physical replication can still have a small portion be used to try to minimize the tracking error as there is something to be said for what kind of tracking error do you accept as the fund's returns may differ from the index by some measure. Yes.  For example, if you were to have a fund that had a 50% and -50% return in back to back periods, what would your final return be?  Answer: -25%, which if you need to visualize this, take $1 that then becomes $1.50 by going up 50% and then becomes $.75 by going down 50% in a compounded fashion.  This is where you have to be careful of the risks of leverage as those returns will compound in a possibly negative way.",Fake,Real,0.9998227953910828,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

I had the chance to briefly meet a couple people from this company. Also, I recognize a number of the names of their financial backers. This doesn't guarantee anything, of course, except the people behind the scenes are no slackers.) The same way Prosper and Lending Club have created a market for personal loans, this is a company that offers real estate loans.  The ""too good to be true"" aspect is what I'll try to address. I've disclosed in other answers that I have my Real Estate license. Earlier this year, I sold a house that was financed with a ""Hard Money"" loan. Not a bank, but a group of investors. They charged the buyer 10%. Let me state - I represented the seller, and when I found out the terms of the loan, it would have been a breach of my own moral and legal responsibility to her to do anything to kill the deal. I felt sick for days after that sale.  There are many people with little credit history who are hard workers and have saved their 20% down. For PeerStreet, 25%. The same way there's a business, local to my area, that offered a 10% loan, PeerStreet is doing something similar but in a 'crowd sourced' way. It seems to me that since they show the duration as only 6-24 months, the buyer typically manages to refinance during that time. I'm guessing that these may be people who are selling their house, but have bad timing, i.e. they need to first close on the sale to qualify to buy the new home. Or simply need the time to get their regular loan approved.  (As a final side note - I recalled the 10% story in a social setting, and more than one person responded they'd have been happy to invest their money at 6%. I could have saved the buyer 4% and gotten someone else nearly 6% more than they get on their cash.)",Fake,Real,0.625245988368988,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3973,79519,"Could someone please provide an example of a portfolio similiar to the GFP or Couch potato, but for Australia?","The portfolio described in that post has a blend of small slices of Vanguard sector funds, such as Vanguard Pacific Stock Index (VPACX).  And the theory is that rebalancing across them will give you a good risk-return tradeoff.  (Caveat: I haven't read the book, only the post you link to.) Similar ETFs are available from Vanguard, iShares, and State Street.  If you want to replicate the GFP exactly, pick from them.  (If you have questions about how to match specific funds in Australia, just ask another question.)  So I think you could match it fairly exactly if you wanted to. However, I think trying to exactly replicate the Gone Fishin Portfolio in Australia would not be a good move for most people, for a few reasons: Brokerage and management fees are generally higher in Australia (smaller market), so dividing your investment across ten different securities, and rebalancing, is going to be somewhat more expensive. If you have a ""middle-class-sized"" portfolio of somewhere in the tens of thousands to low millions of dollars, you're cutting it into fairly small slices to manually allocate 5% to various sectors.  To keep brokerage costs low you probably want to buy each ETF only once every one-two years or so.  You also need to keep track of the tax consequences of each of them. If you are earning and spending Australian dollars, and looking at the portfolio in Australian dollars, a lot of those assets are going to move together as the Australian dollar moves, regardless of changes in the underlying assets.  So there is effectively less diversification than you would have in the US. The post doesn't mention the GFP's approach to tax.  I expect they do consider it, but it's not going to be directly applicable to Australia. If you are more interested in implementing the general approach of GFP rather than the specific details, what I would recommend is: The Vanguard and superannuation diversified funds have a very similar internal split to the GFP with a mix of local, first-world and emerging market shares, bonds, and property trusts.  This is pretty much fire-and-forget: contribute every month and they will take care of rebalancing, spreading across asset classes, and tax calculations.  By my calculations the cost is very similar, the diversification is very similar, and it's much easier. The only thing they don't generally cover is a precious metals allocation, and if you want that, just put 5% of your money into the ASX:GOLD ETF, or something similar.",Fake,Real,0.6673014163970947,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

3979,79565,"When one pays Quarterly Estimated Self Employment Taxes, exactly what are they paying?","Your question does not say this explicitly, but I assume that you were once a W-2 employee.  Each paycheck a certain amount was withheld from your check to pay income, social security, and medicare taxes.  Just because you did not receive that amount of money earned does not mean it was immediately sent to the IRS.  While I am not all that savvy on payroll procedures, I recall an article that indicated some companies only send in withheld taxes every quarter, much like you are doing now.  They get a short term interest free loan.  For example taxes withheld by a w-2 employee in the later months of the year may not be provided to the IRS until 15 January of the next year.   You are correct in assuming that if you make 100K as a W-2 you will probably pay less in taxes than someone who is 100K self employed with 5K in expenses.  However there are many factors.  Provided you properly fill out a 1040ES, and pay the correct amount of quarterly payments, you will almost never owe taxes.  In fact my experience has been the forms will probably allow you to receive a refund.  Tax laws can change and one thing the form did not include last year was the .9% Medicare surcharge for high income earners catching some by surprise.    As far as what you pay into is indicative of the games the politicians play.  It all just goes into a big old bucket of money, and more is spent by congress than what is in the bucket.  The notion of a ""social security lockbox"" is pure politics/fantasy as well as the notion of medicare and social security taxes.  The latter were created to make the actual income tax rate more palatable.     I'd recommend getting your taxes done as early as possible come 1 January 2017.  While you may not have all the needed info, you could firm up an estimate by 15 Jan and modify the amount for your last estimated payment.  Complete the taxes when all stuff comes in and even if you owe an amount you have time to save for anything additional.  Keep in mind, between 1 Jan 17 and 15 Apr 17 you will earn and presumably save money to use towards taxes.  You can always ""rob"" from that money to pay any owed tax for 2016 and make it up later.

[duplicate],"After the initial public offering, the company can raise money by selling more stock (equity financing) or selling debt (e.g. borrowing money).  If a company's stock price is high, they can raise money with equity financing on more favorable terms.  When companies raise money with equity financing, they create new shares and dilute the existing shareholders, so the number of shares outstanding is not fixed. Companies can also return money to shareholders by buying their own equity, and this is called a share repurchase.  It's best for companies to repurchase their shared when their stock price is low, but ""American companies have a terrible track record of buying their own shares high and selling them low."" The management of a company typically likes a rising stock price, so their stock options are more valuable and they can justify bigger pay packages.",Real,Fake,0.9092397689819336,,,,,,,,,,0,1,1
3984,79609,"How companies choose earnings release dates, & effect on Implied Volatility","I can't speak authoritatively to your broader question about stocks in general, but in several years tracking AAPL closely, I can tell you that there's little apparent pattern to when their earnings call will be, or when it will be announced. What little I do know:  - AAPL's calls tend to occur on a Tuesday more than any other day of the week  - it's announced roughly a month in advance, but has been announced w/ less notice  - it has a definite range of dates in which it occurs, typically somewhere in the 3rd week of the new quarter plus or minus a few days More broadly for #1: Given the underlying nature of what an option is, then yes, the day an earnings call date is announced could certainly influence the IV/price of options - but only for options that expire inside the ""grey area"" (~2 weeks long) window in which the call could potentially occur.  Options expiring outside that grey area should experience little to no price change in reaction to the announcement of the date - unless the date was itself surprising, e.g. an earlier date would increase the premium on earlier dated options, a later date would increase the premium for later-dated options. As for #2: The exact date will probably always be a mystery, but the main factors are:  - the historical pattern of earnings call dates (and announcements of those dates) which you can look up for any given company  - when the company's quarter ends  - potentially some influence in how long it takes the company to close out their books for the quarter (some types of businesses would be faster than others)  - any special considerations for this particular quarter that affect reporting ability And finally:   - a surprise of an earnings call occurring (substantively) later than usual is rarely going to be a good sign for the underlying security, and the expectation of catastrophe - while cratering the underlying - may also cause a disproportionate rise in IVs/prices due to fear",Fake,Real,0.995050847530365,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

As you loan money to the company, the company has no income, but gains an asset and a liability. When the company then uses the money to pay the bills it does have expenses that accumulate to the end of the accounting period where they have to be declared. These expenses are payed from the asset gained and has no effect to the liability. When the company then makes a profit it is taxable. How ever this taxable profit may be deducted from from a tax reserve accumulated over the last loss periods up to ten years. When the company then pays the loan back it is divided in principal and interest. The principal payment is a deduction in the company's liabilities and has no tax effect. The interest payment the again does have effect in taxes in the way of decreasing them. On your personal side giving loan has no effect. Getting the principal back has no effect. Getting interest for the loan is taxable income.

Securities become almost perfectly correlated during a crash; therefore, market crash risk of one security is essentially equal to the market crash risk, so hedging the security itself makes a position market neutral for crash risk. This strategy will have intermittent opportunity cost risk in the form of slower returns during market expansion to pay for smaller losses during a crash; however, the expected long run return hedged this way should be greater than the underlying's expected long run return with less volatility.",Fake,Real,0.9982808828353882,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

If they don't want to do the work to give you a loan, there are other lenders who do. Rarely agree to ""points"".  If you know -- and I don't mean ""think"", I mean ""know"" -- if you know that you are going to hold that loan much longer than it would take to repay those points, then maybe.

4012,79847,"Are spot market ,regular market and ready market same in stock trading if not then what is the difference?","So, the term ""ready market"" simply means that a market exists in which there are legitimate buy/sell offers, meaning there are investors willing to own or trade in the security. A ""spot market"" means that the security/commodity is being delivered immediately, rather at some predetermined date in the future (hence the term ""futures market"").  So if you buy oil on the spot market, you'd better be prepared to take immediate delivery, where as when you buy a futures contract, the transaction doesn't happen until some later date.  The advantage for futures contract sellers is the ability to lock in the price of what they're selling as a hedge against the possibility of a price drop between now and when they can/will deliver the commodity.  In other words, a farmer can pre-sell his grain at a set price for some future delivery date so he can know what he's going to get regardless of the price of grain at the time he delivers it.  The downside to the farmer is that if grain prices rise higher than what he sold them for as futures contracts then he loses that additional money.  That's the advantage to the buyer, who expects the price to rise so he can resell what he bought from the farmer at a profit. When you trade on margin, you're basically borrowing the money to make a trade, whether you're trading long (buying) or short (selling) on a security.  It isn't uncommon for traders to pledge securities they already own as collateral for a margin account, and if they are unable to cover a margin call then those securities can be liquidated or confiscated to satisfy the debt.  There still may even be a balance due after such a liquidation if the pledged securities don't cover the margin call. Most of the time you pay a fee (or interest rate) on whatever you borrow on margin, just like taking out a bank loan, so if you're going to trade on margin, you have to include those costs in your calculations as to what you need to earn from your investment to make a profit. When I short trade, I'm selling something I don't own in the expectation I can buy it back later at a lower price and keep the difference.  For instance, if I think Apple shares are going to take a steep drop at some point soon, I can short them.  So imagine I short-sell 1000 shares of AAPL at the current price of $112.  That means my brokerage account is credited with the proceeds of the sale ($112,000), and I now owe my broker 1000 shares of AAPL stock.  If the stock drops to $100 and I ""cover my short"" (buy the shares back to repay the 1000 I borrowed) then I pay $100,000 for them and give them to my broker.  I keep the difference ($12,000) between what I sold them for and what I paid to buy them back, minus any brokerage fees and fees the broker may charge me for short-selling. In conclusion, a margin trade is using someone else's money to make a trade, whether it's to buy more or to sell short.  A short trade is selling shares I don't even own because I think I can make money in the process. I hope this helps.",Fake,Real,0.9933698177337646,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Say the closing price had been unchanged at $20.00.  The close prices would say I made no profit, but the adjusted closing price would say I made $0.18 per share on this investment because the adjusted close would read $19.82 in June 2015 but would read $20.00 in August 2015 (just like the closing price).

4032,80076,Is this formula accurate for weighing the difference between an S-Corp and LLC?,"It might be best to step back and look at the core information first.  You're evaluating an LLC vs a Corporation (both corporate entities).  Both have one or more members, and both are seen similarly (emphasis on SIMILAR here, they're not all the same) to the IRS.  Specifically, LLC's can opt for a pass-through tax system, basically seen by the IRS the same way an S-Corp is. Put another way, you can be taxed as a corporate entity, or it's P/L statements can ""flow through"" to your personal taxes.  When you opt for a flow-through, the business files and you get a separate schedule to tie into your taxes.  You should also look at filing a business expense schedule (Schedule C) on your taxes to claim legitimate business expenses (good reference point here). While there are several differences (see this, and this, and this) between these entities, the best determination on which structure is best for you is usually if you have full time employ while you're running the business.  S corps limit shares, shareholders and some deductions, but taxes are only paid by the shareholders.  C corps have employees, no restrictions on types or number of stock, and no restrictions on the number of shareholders.  However, this means you would become an employee of your business (you have to draw monies from somewhere) and would be subject to paying taxes on your income, both as an individual, and as a business (employment taxes such as Social Security, Medicare, etc). From the broad view of the IRS, in most cases an LLC and a Corp are the same type of entity (tax wise).  In fact, most of the differences between LLCs and Corps occur in how Profits/losses are distributed between members (LLCs are arbitrary to a point, and Corps base this on shares). Back to your question IMHO, you should opt for an LLC.  This allows you to work out a partnership with your co-worker, and allows you to disburse funds in a more flexible manner.  From Wikipedia : A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law. Hope this helps, please do let me know if you have further questions.  As always, this is not legal or tax advice, just what I've learned in setting several LLCs and Corporate structures up over the years. EDIT: As far as your formulas go, the tax rate will be based upon your personal income, for any pass through entity.  This means that the same monies earned from and LLC or an S-corp, with the same expenses and the same pass-through options will be taxed the same.

4033,80086,Usage of a sell stop order,"It depends to some extent on how you interpret the situation, so I think this is the general idea. Say you purchase one share at $50, and soon after, the price moves up, say, to $55. You now have an unrealized profit of $5. Now, you can either sell and realize that profit, or hold on to the position, expecting a further price appreciation. In either case, you will consider the price change from this traded price, which is $55, and not the price you actually bought at. Hence, if the price fell to $52 in the next trade, you have a loss of $3 on your previous profit of $5. This (even though your net P&L is calculated from the initial purchase price of $50), allows you to think in terms of your positions at the latest known prices. This is similar to a Markov process, in the sense that it doesn't matter which route the stock price (and your position's P&L) took to get to the current point; your decision should be based on the current/latest price level.",Fake,Real,0.6378718614578247,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

4042,80185,What are NSCC illiquid charges?,"NSCC illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low-priced over-the counter (OTC) securities with low volumes. Open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle. Open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm Basically, you can't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid OTC stock without facing a fee. You'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions. Open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle. Open net sell quantity must be less than 10% percent of the 20-day average volume If you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10% of the stock's average volume over the last 20 days, you'll also be assessed a fee. The first link I included above is just an example, but it makes the important point: you may still be assessed a fee for trading OTC stocks even if your account doesn't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm, not the individual client.  This means that if other investors with your broker, or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm, purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual OTC stock at the same time, all of your accounts may face fees, even though individually, you don't exceed the limits. Technically, these fees are assessed to the clearing firm, not the individual investor, but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker (and possibly add other charges as well), and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s) that triggered the restriction. Also, remember that when buying OTC/pink sheet stocks, your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from/sell to. If you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future, but there aren't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you, you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price, or even at all.",Fake,Real,0.9710146188735962,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

4055,80261,Why are taxes on actively managed funds higher than those on index funds?,"First, consider what causes taxes to apply to a mutual fund, index or actively managed.  Dividends and capital gains are generally what will be distributed to shareholders given the nature of a mutual fund since the fund itself doesn't pay taxes.  For funds held in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts, this isn't a concern and thus people may not have this concern for those situations which can account for a lot of investing situations as people may have 401(k)s and IRAs that hold their investments rather than taxable accounts. Second, there can be tax-managed funds so there can be cases where a fund is managed with taxes in mind that is worth noting here as what is referenced is a ""Dummies"" link that is making a generalization.  For taxable accounts, it may make more sense to have a tax-managed fund rather than an index fund though I'd also argue to be careful of asset allocation as to maintain a purity of style can require selling of stocks that grow too big and thus trigger capital gains,e.g. small-cap and mid-cap funds that can't hold onto the winners as they would become mid-cap and large-cap instead of representing the proper asset class. A FUND THAT PLAYED IT SAFE--AND WAS SORRY would be a Businessweek story from 1998 of an actively managed fund that went mostly to cash and missed the rise of the stock market at that time if you want a specific example of what an actively managed fund can do that an index fund often cannot do.

4059,80292,What is Systematic about Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and who invented it?,"Personally, I think you are approaching this from the wrong angle.  You're somewhat correct in assuming that what you're reading is usually some kind of marketing material.  Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is not a universal piece of jargon in the financial world.  Dollar cost averaging is a pretty universal piece of jargon in the financial world and is a common topic taught in finance classes in the US. On average, verified by many studies, individuals will generate better investment returns when they proactively avoid timing the market or attempting to pick specific winners.  Say you decide to invest in a mutual fund, dollar cost averaging means you invest the same dollar amount in consistent intervals rather than buying a number of shares or buying sporadically when you feel the market is low. As an example I'll compare investing $50 per week on Wednesdays, versus 1 share per week on Wednesdays, or the full $850 on the first Wednesday.   I'll use the Vanguard Large cap fund as an example (VLCAX).  I realize this is not really an apples to apples comparison as the invested amounts are different, I just wanted to show how your rate of return can change depending on how your money goes in to the market even if the difference is subtle.  By investing a common dollar amount rather than a common share amount you ultimately maintain a lower average share price while the share price climbs.  It also keeps your investment easy to budget. Vanguard published an excellent paper discussing dollar cost averaging versus lump sum investing which concluded that you should invest as soon as you have funds, rather than parsing out a lump sum in to smaller periodic investments, which is illustrated in the third column above; and obviously worked out well as the market has been increasing. Ultimately, all of these companies are vying to customers so they all have marketing teams trying to figure out how to make their services sound interesting and unique.  If they all called dollar cost averaging, ""dollar cost averaging"" none of them would appear to be unique.  So they devise neat acronyms but it's all pretty much the same idea.

For instance, the interest rate applicable for overnight long positions may be 6% or 0.06. To calculate how much it would cost you to hold a long position for X number of days you would need to make this 'pro rata' meaning that you would need to divide the 0.06 by 365 and multiply it by X days and then multiply this by the trade size. So for example, for a trade size of $20,000, held for 30 days, the interest cost would be about $98.6.

You could theoretically max out the SIMPLE IRA ($11,500) and then contribute $4,000 to your 401k, but your total can't exceed the 401k limit of $16,500.  This also means you could max out your 401k at $16,500, but you couldn't contribute anything to the SIMPLE IRA.  Note that no matter what, you can't contribute more than $11,500 to your SIMPLE IRA. (Note that this is all independent from your Traditional or Roth IRA, which are subject to their own limits, and not affected by your participation in employer-sponsored plans.) As I understand it, a 401k and a SIMPLE IRA both fall under the umbrella of ""employer-sponsored plans"".  Just like you can't max out two 401k's at two different employers, you can't do it with the 401k and the SIMPLE IRA.  The only weird thing is the contribution limit differences between SIMPLE IRA and 401k, but I don't think the IRS could/would penalize you for working two jobs (enforcing the lower SIMPLE IRA limit for all employer-sponsored retirement accounts). You should probably run the numbers, factoring in the employer match, and figure out which account-contribution scenario makes the most financial sense for you.  However, I'm not sure how the employer match helps you when you're talking about a small business that you own/run.

To consider whether it's hobby, a few rules are applied such as: How much time do you spend on the activity? And is the hourly wage low? Obviously, having a boss is a sure sign of it not being a hobby. The typical example is making dolls and selling them on a crafts fair. If you travel the country and sell each weekend on a different fair, that's a lot of time. If you only sell them on the fair in your home town, it's a hobby.  Situation 3 is the most difficult. If you just happened to luck out, it's still a hobby. If you spent significant time to improve the value of your holdings, e.g. by trading in-game, then it might be seen as work. In the latter case, you simply file it as ""income from other sources, not yet taxed"".  For the purpose of determining income from a hobby, you may deduct actual expenses.

By ""believe it is money"", I mean that they expect they will be able to turn it into useful goods or services (food, rent, houses, truckloads full of iron ore, mining equipment, massages at the spa, helicopter rides, iPads, greenhouses, income streams to support your future retirement, etc). Foreign exchange rates change because people's ideas about how much useful goods or services they can get with various currencies change. For example: if the Zimbabwe government suddenly printed 10 times as much money as used to exist, you probably couldn't use that money to buy as much food at the Zimbabwe-Mart, so you wouldn't be willing to give people as many US-dollars (which can buy food at the US-Mart) for a Zimbabwe-dollar as you used to be able to. (It's not exactly that easy, because - for instance - food in the US is more useful to me than food in Zimbabwe. But people still move around all sorts of things, like oil, or agricultural products, or minerals, or electronics components.) The two main things that affect the value of a currency are the size of the economy that it's tied to (how much stuff there is to get), and how much of the currency there is / how fast it's moving around the economy (which tells you how much money there is to get it with). So most exchange rate shifts reflect a change in people's expectations for a regional economy, or the size of a money supply. (Also, Zimbabwe is doing much better now that it's ditched their own currency - they kept printing trillions of dollars' worth - and just trade in US dollars.

4097,80770,How should minor children be listed as IRA beneficiaries?,"I would like to bring up some slightly different points than the ones raised in the excellent answers from JoeTaxpayer and littleadv.  The estate can be the beneficiary of an IRA -- indeed, as has been pointed out, this is the default beneficiary if the owner does not specify a beneficiary -- but a testamentary trust cannot be the designated  beneficiary of an IRA. A testamentary trust that meets the requirements laid out on page 36 of Publication 590 is essentially a pass-through  entity that takes distributions from the IRA and passes them on to the beneficiaries.   For the case being considered here of minor beneficiaries, the distributions from the  IRA that pass through  the trust must be sent to the legal guardians (or other custodians) of the minors' UTMA accounts, and said guardians must invest these sums for the benefit of the minors and hand the monies over when the minors reach adulthood. Minors are not responsible for their support, and so these monies cannot be used by the legal guardian for oaying the minors' living expenses except as provided for in the UTMA regulations. When the minors become adults, they get all the accumulated value on their UTMA accounts, and can start taking  the RMDs personally after that, and blowing them on motorcycles if they wish.  Thus, the advantage of the testamentary trust is essentially that it lets the trustee of the trust to decide how much money (over and above the RMD) gets distributed each year.  The minors and soon-to-be young adults cannot take the entire IRA in a lump sum etc but must abide by the testamentary trustee's ideas of whether extra money (over and above the RMD) should be taken out  in any given year. How much discretion is allowed to the trustee is also something to be thought through carefully. But at least the RMD must be taken from the IRA and distributed to the minors' UTMA accounts (or to the persons as they reach adulthood) each year.  Regardless of whether the Traditional IRA goes to beneficiaries  directly or through a testamentary trust, its value (as of the date of death) is still included in the estate, and estate tax  might be due. However, beneficiaries can deduct the portion of estate tax paid by the estate from the income tax that they have to pay on the IRA withdrawals. Estate planning is very tricky business, and even lawyers very competent in estate and trust issues fall far short in their understanding of tax law, especially income tax law.",Fake,Real,0.5183895230293274,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

Ideally you'd use an accounting software like QuickBooks or similar. Create a Capital Contributions account and every time you put money into the business checking account record it as a Capital Contribution. Likewise, if you take money out of the business, it comes from your capital accounts. (You can create a separate Capital Distributions account in your accounting software, or just use a single account for contributions and distributions). Money coming in and out of those capital accounts is not taxable because you will pay taxes based on net earnings regardless of whether or not you have distributed any profits. So there's no need to make a loan to the company, which would have tax consequences. To reimburse yourself for purchases already made, submit an expense report to the company. If the company is unfunded right now, you can make a capital contribution to cover current expenses, submit the expense report, and wait until you have some profits before paying out the expense report or making any distributions.

You also have to pay the commission on the sell. 50% times 50% is 25%.So you have, at best a 25% chance of buying low and selling high.

4109,80881,"Child is on the way, invest for college and car fund options - opinions","Look at your options with a 529 program. If the money is used for education expenses: that currently includes tuition, room & board (even if living off campus), books, transportation; it grows tax free. Earnings are not subject to federal tax and generally not subject to   state tax when used for the qualified education expenses of the   designated beneficiary, such as tuition, fees, books, as well as room   and board. Contributions to a 529 plan, however, are not deductible. If it is a 529 associated with your state you can also save on state taxes. You can make contributions on a regular basis, or ad hoc. Accounts can even be setup by other relatives. I have used a 529 to fund two kids education. It takes care of most of your education expenses.  529 programs are available from most states, and even some of the big mutual fund companies. Many have the option of shifting the risk level of the investments to be more conservative as the kids hit high school.  Some states have an option to have you pay  a large sum when the child is small to buy semesters of college. The deal is worth considering if you know they will be going to a state school, the deal is less good if they will go out of state or to a private college.  The IRS does limit the maximum amount that you can contribute in a year an amount that exceeds the 14,000 annual gift limit: If in 2014, you contributed more than $14,000 to a Qualified Tuition   Plan (QTP) on behalf of any one person, you may elect to treat up to   $70,000 of the contribution for that person as if you had made it   ratably over a 5-year period. The election allows you to apply the   annual exclusion to a portion of the contribution in each of the 5   years, beginning in 2014. You can make this election for as many   separate people as you made QTP contributions One option at the end is to take any extra money at graduation and give it to the child so that it can be used for graduate school, or if the taxes and penalties are paid it can be used for that first car.

Often stocks go on a Run up when RSI is over 70!   - I use Stoch RSI or CCI to confirm my status on RSI. I like to see that all 3 indicators agree.

4130,81061,Why do people buy US dollars on the black market?,"As a Venezuelan who used to buy USD, I believe there is not better explanation than the one given to someone who actually lives and works here in Venezuela. Back in 1998 when Hugo Chavez took the presidency, we had a good economy. Fast forward 10 years laters and you could see how poor management, corruption and  communist measurements had wreaked havoc in our Economy. It was because most of the money (USD) coming in Venezuela were not invested here but instead, given away to ""pimp countries"" like Cuba. Remember, communism lasts while you have money. Back then we had an Oil Barrel going over 100$ and crazy amounts of money were coming in the country. However, little to no money was invested in the country itself. That is why some of the richest people with bank account in Swiss are Venezuelans who stole huge amounts of Oil Money.  I know this is a lot to take in, but all of this led to Venezuelan economy being the worst in The American Continent and because there is not enough money inside the country to satisfy the inner market, people would pay overprice to have anything that is bought abroad. You have to consider that only a very small amount of people can actually buy USD here in Venezuela. Back in 2013 I was doing it, I could buy about 80 usd/month with my monthly income. However, nowdays that's nearly impossible for about 99% of Venezuelans.  To Illustrate. Minimum wage = 10.000 bolivares / month Black market exchange rate (As of January 2016) = 900bs per 1usd 10.000/900 = 11,11 usd.   <<< that is what about 50% of Venezuelans earn every month. That's why this happens:  http://i.imgur.com/dPOC2e3.jpg The guy is holding a huge stack of money of the highest Venezuelan note, which he got from exchanging only 100 usd. I am a computer science engineer, the monthly income for someone like me is about 30.000 bolivares --- so that is about 34$ a month. oh dear! So finally, answering your question Q: Why do people buy USD even at this unfavorable rate? A: There are many reasons but being the main 2 the following 1.- Inflation in Venezuela is crazy high. The inflation from 2014-2015 was 241%. Which means that having The Venezuelan currency (Bolivares) in your bank account makes no sense... in two weeks you won't be able to buy half of the things you used to with the same amount of money. 2.- A huge amount of Venezuelans dream with living abroad (me included) why, you ask? well sir, it is certain that life in this country is not the best: I hope you can understand better why people in 3rd world countries and crappy economies buy USD even at an unfavorable rate. The last question was: Q: Why would Venezuela want to block the sale of dollars? A: Centralized currency management is an Economic Measure that should last 6 months tops. (This was Argentina's case in 2013) but at this point, reverting that would take quite a few years.  However, Turukawa's wikipedia link explains that very well.

4131,81081,How to diversify IRA portfolio given fund minimum investments and IRA contribution limits?,"Many mutual fund companies (including Vanguard when I checked many years ago) require smaller minimum investments (often $1000) for IRA and 401k accounts.  Some also allow for smaller investments into their funds for  IRA accounts if you set up an automatic investment plan that contributes  a fixed amount of money each month or each quarter.  On the other hand,  many mutual fund companies charge an annual account maintenance fee ($10? $20? $25? more?) per fund for IRA investments unless the balance in the fund is above a certain amount (often $5K or $10K$).  This fee can be paid in cash or deducted from the IRA investment, and the former option is vastly better. So, diversification into multiple funds while starting out with an IRA is not that great an idea. It is far better to get diversification through investment in an S&P 500 Index fund (VFINX since you won't have access to @JoeTaxpayer's VIIIX) or a Total Market Index fund or, if you prefer, a Target Retirement Fund, and then branch out into other types of mutual funds as your investment grows through future contributions and dividends etc. To answer your question about fund minimums, the IRA account is separate from a taxable investment account, and the minimum rule applies to each separately.

4150,81310,Loan math problem,"Lachlan has $600 cash and a car worth $500. That's $1,100. The new car is priced at $21,800. Lachlan needs a loan for $20,700. However, the finance company insists that the buyer must pay a 10% deposit, which is $2,180. Lachlan only has $1,100, so no loan.  The car dealer wants to make a sale, so suggests some tricks. The car dealer could buy Lachlan's old banger for $1,500 instead of $500, and sell the new car for $22,800 instead of $21,800. Doesn't make a difference to the dealer, he gets the same amount of cash. Now Lachlan has $600 cash and $1,500 for his car or $2,100 in total. He needs 10% of $22,800 as deposit which is $2,280. That's not quite there but you see how the principle works. Lachlan is about $200 short. So the dealer adds $1,200 to both car prices. Lachlan has $600 cash and a car ""worth"" $1,700, total $2,300. The new car is sold for $23,000 requiring a $2,300 deposit which works out exactly.  How could we have found the right amount without guessing?  Lachlan had $1,100. The new car costs $21,800. The dealer increases both prices by x dollars. Lachlan has now $1,100 + x deposit. The car now costs $21,800 + x. The deposit should be 10%, so $1,100 + x = 10% of ($21,800 + x) = $2,180 + 0.1 x.  $1,100 + x = $2,180 + 0.1 x : Subtract $1,100 x = $1,080 + 0.1 x : Subtract 0.1 x 0.9 x = $1,080 : Divide by 0.9 x = $1,080 / 0.9 = $1,200 The dealer inflates the cost of the new car and the value of the old car by $1,200.

You need to be able to effectively communicate your financial plans and goals, your financial actions, and learn to both be honest and open with your partner.  You also need to be certain that you come to an agreement. The first step is to draft a budget that you both agree to follow.  The following is a rough outline that you could use to begin.  There are online budgeting tools, and a spreadsheet where you can track planned versus actuals may better inform your decisions. Depending upon your agreed priorities, you may adjust the following percentages, Essentials (<50% of net income) Financial (>20%) Lifestyle (<30%) - this is your discretionary income, where you spend on the things you want Certain expense categories are large and deserve special advice. Try to limit your housing costs to 25% of your income, unless you live in a high-cost/rent area (where you might budget as high as 35%). Limit your expenses for vehicles below 10% of income. And expensive vehicle might be budgeted (partly) from Lifestyle. Limiting your auto payment to 5% of your income may be a wise choice (when possible). Some families spend $200-300/month on cable TV, and $200-300/month on cellphones. These are Lifestyle decisions, and those on constrained budgets might examine the value from those expenses against the benefit.

4159,81451,My employer doesn't provide an electronic pay stub and I need one to get a car loan,"You have a few options and sometimes challenges help us improve our situation. First, you can not borrow to buy a car.  Reducing the massive depreciation that cars undergo will help you be wealthier.  It is hard to find a good use car that you can buy for cash, but it will play out best for your finances in the long run. If your heart is set on borrowing, I would encourage you to go to the bank/credit union where you have your checking account.  They will see your history of deposits and may grant you a loan based on that.  Also you are likely to get a better deal from the bank than from the car dealer. Thirdly, you can simply go to your employer's HR department and ask them.  Surely someone has applied for a loan during the company's history.

4161,81457,Buying under my bid price,"It definitely depends on the exchange you are trading on. I'm not familiar with Scottrade, but a standard practice is to fulfill limit orders in the order they are placed.   Most of the time, you wouldn't see stocks trade significantly under your bid price, but since penny stocks are very volatile, it's more likely their price could drop quickly past your bid and then return above it while only fulfilling a portion of the orders placed. Example 1. Penny stock priced at $0.12 2. Others place limit orders to buy at $0.10 3. You place limit order to buy at $0.10 4. Stock price drops to $0.07 and some orders are filled (anything $0.07 or higher) based on a first-come first-served basis 5. Due to the increase in purchases of the penny stock, the price rises above $0.10 before your order is filled ***EDIT*** - Adding additional clarification from comment section. A second example If the price drops from $0.12 to $0.07, then orders for all prices from $0.07 and above will start to be filled from the oldest order first. That might mean that the oldest order was a limit buy order for 100 shares at $0.09, and since that is above the current ask price, it will be filled first. The next order might be for 800 shares at $0.07. It's possible for a subset of these to be filled (let's say 400) before the share's price increases from the increased demand. Then, if the price goes above $0.10, your bid will not be filled during that time.",Fake,Real,0.9730708003044128,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0
4162,81467,How to compute for losses in an upside down trade-in of a financed car?,"I'm going to ignore your numbers to avoid spending the time to understand them.  I'm just going to go over the basic moving parts of trading an upside down car against another financed car because I think you're conflating price and value.  I'm also going to ignore taxes, and fees, and depreciation. The car has an acquisition cost (price) then it has a value.  You pay the price to obtain this thing, then in the future it is worth what someone else will pay you. When you finance a car you agree to your $10,000 price, then you call up Mr. Bank and agree to pay 10% per year for 5 years on that $10,000.  Mr. Banker wires over $10,000 and you drive home in your car.   Say in a year you want a different car.  This new car has a price of $20,000, and wouldn't you know it they'll even buy your current car from you.  They'll give you $7,000 to trade in your current car. Your current car has a value of $7,000.  You've made 12 payments of $188.71.  Of those payments about $460 was interest, you now owe about $8,195 to Mr. Banker. The new dealership needs to send payment to Mr. Banker to get the title for your current car.  They'll send the $7,000 they agreed to pay for your car.  Then they'll loan you the additional $1,195 ($8,195 owed on the car minus $7,000 trade in value).   Your loan on the new car will be for $21,195, $20,000 for the new car and $1,195 for the amount you still owed on the old car after the dealership paid you $7,000 for your old car. It doesn't matter what your down-payment was on the old car, it doesn't matter what your payment was before, it doesn't matter what you bought your old car for.  All that matters is how much you owe on it today and how much the buyer (the dealership) is willing to pay you for it. How much of this is ""loss"" is an extremely vague number to derive primarily because your utility of the car has a value.  But it could be argued that the $1,195 added on to your new car loan to pay for the old car is lost.",Fake,Real,0.8482111692428589,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

4170,81625,Ways to save for child's college education where one need not commit to set contributions? [duplicate],"Since this post was migrated from Parenting, my reply was in the context where it appeared to be misrepresenting facts to make a point. I've edited it to be more concise to my main point. In my opinion, the best way to save for your childs future is to get rid of as much of your own debt as possible. Starting today. For the average American, a car is 6-10%. Most people have at least a couple credit cards, ranging from 10-25% (no crap). College loans can be all over the map (5-15%) as can be signature (8-15%) or secured bank loans (4-8%). Try to stop living within your credit and live within your means. Yeah it will suck to not go to movies or shop for cute things at Kohl's, but only today.  First, incur no more debt. Then, the easiest way I found to pay things off is to use your tax returns and reduce your cable service (both potentially $Ks per year) to pay off a big debt like a car or student loan. You just gave yourself an immediate raise of whatever your payment is. If you think long term (we're talking about long-term savings for a childs college) there are things you can do to pay off debt and save money without having to take up a 2nd job... but you have to think in terms of years, not months. Is this kind of thing pie in the sky? Yes and no, but it takes a plan and diligence. For example, we have no TV service (internet only service redirected an additional $100/mo to the wifes lone credit card) and we used '12 taxes to pay off the last 4k on the car. We did the same thing on our van last year. It takes willpower to not cheat, but that's only really necessary for the first year-ish... well before that point you'll be used to the Atkins Diet on your wallet and will have no desire to cheat. It doesn't really hurt your quality of life (do you really NEED 5 HBO channels?) and it sets everyone up for success down the line. The moral of the story is that by paying down your debt today, you're taking steps to reduce long haul expenditures.

4174,81764,Is there a “reverse wash sale” rule? ,"Yes, the newly bought shares will have a long-term holding period, regardless of when you sell them.  In addition, it's only a wash sale if you sold the first shares for a loss; it's not a wash sale if you sold them for a gain. Wikipedia mentions this: When a wash sale occurs, the holding period for the replacement stock includes the period you held the stock you sold. Example: You've held shares of XYZ for 10 years. You sell it at a loss but then buy it back within the wash sale period. When you sell the replacement stock, your gain or loss will be long-term — no matter how soon you sell it. Charles Schwab also mentions this: Here's a quick example of a wash sale. On 9/30/XX, you buy 500 shares of ABC at $10 per share. One year later the stock price starts to drop, and you sell all your shares at $9 per share on 10/4/XY. Two days later, on 10/6, ABC bottoms out at $8 and you buy 500 shares again. This series of trades triggers a wash sale.

If, instead, I put 3 quarters in to get the Coke, I don't record that expense at all.  Spending coins is ""free money.""  We do this mainly because it is just easier to keep track of.  I can quickly count the cash in my wallet and verify that it matches the amount that YNAB thinks I have in my wallet, and I don't need to worry about the coins.  Coins that are in my car to pay for parking meters or coins in the dish on my dresser don't need to be counted.

4183,81873,Are all financial advisors compensated in the same way?,"No, they certainly are not compensated the same way.  Some are paid by commission that they earn from the products they sell (ie, certain mutual funds, insurance, etc.)  Others are paid for their advice based on an hourly fee, or a percentage of the portfolio you have to invest.

You cannot use inflation-removed estimates of equity rates of return because those returns do not change with inflation.  If anything they move in opposite directions.

The primary goal of a company doing secondary public offering is to raise more funds, that can be utilized for funding the business.

For example with the current 100 invested, the company is able to generate say 125 [25 as profit]. If additional 100 is taken as secondary public offering, then with 200, the company should mark around 250, else it looses value.

If your IRA does go over the UBI limit, your IRA (not you) needs to file a return.  In that case, contact your custodian and tell them about the Schedule K that you got.

4194,82040,Is laminate flooring an “Improvement” or “Depreciable Property”?,"Aesthetics aside, laminate floor is attached to the floor and as such is a part of the building. So you depreciate it with the building itself, similarly to the roof. I believe the IRS considers these permanently attached because the foam itself is permanently attached, and is a part of the installation. To the best of my knowledge, the only flooring that is considered as a separate unit of property is tucked-in carpet or carpet pads (typically installed in commercial buildings, not homes). Everything else you'll have to prove to be an independent separate unit of property. Technically, you can take the tucked in carpet, and move it elsewhere as-is and be able to install it there assuming the size fits. You cannot do it with the foam (at the very least you'll need a new foam cover in the new location since you cannot take the foam with you from the old one). That's the difference between a ""separate unit of property"" and ""part of the building"".

4205,82140,A little advice please…car loan related,"Suggested way to make the decision to repair or buy: Figure out what it will cost to repair your car. (If necessary, pay a garage to evaluate it ""as if your daughter was interested in buying it"".) Then think about whether you would pay that much to buy a car just like yours but without those problems. If the answer is yes, fixing it us probably your most cost-effective choice, even if it is a big bill. If the answer is no, consider a used car, and again have the mechanic check it for any lurking horrors before committing to buy it. That avoids the ""proprty-line tax"" where a new car loses a significant percentage of its value the moment it leaves the dealership. An almost-toy car us virtually indistinguishable from a new car, costs much less, and realistically has about the same expected life span. I bought a new car once -- at about $300 over the dealer's real (as opposed to sticker) cost, since I was willing to take the one he was stuck with from the previous model year. (Thank you, Consumer Reports, for providing the dealer's cost info and making this a five-minute transaction.) If it hadn't suffered flood damage I'd probably still be driving it, and even so I sorta regret not pricing what it would have cost go completely replace the engine. If you really plan to drive it until it is completely unrepairable, you may be able to justify a new car...

4206,82145,"Pros & cons in Hungary of investing retirement savings exclusively in silver? What better alternatives, given my concerns?","Like Jeremy T said above, silver is a value store and is to be used as a hedge against sovereign currency revaluations.  Since every single currency in the world right now is a free-floating fiat currency, you need silver (or some other firm, easily store-able, protect-able, transportable asset class; e.g. gold, platinum, ... whatever...) in order to protect yourself against government currency devaluations, since the metal will hold its value regardless of the valuation of the currency which you are denominating it in (Euro, in your case).  Since the ECB has been hesitant to ""print"" large amounts of currency (which causes other problems unrelated to precious metals), the necessity of hedging against a plummeting currency exchange rate is less important and should accordingly take a lower percentage in your diversification strategy.  However, if you were in.. say... Argentina, for example, you would want to have a much larger percentage of your assets in precious metals. The EU has a lot of issues, and depreciation of hard assets courtesy of a lack of fluid currency/capital (and overspending on a lot of EU governments' parts in the past), in my opinion, lessens the preservative value of holding precious metals.  You want to diversify more heavily into precious metals just prior to government sovereign currency devaluations, whether by ""printing"" (by the ECB in your case) or by hot capital flows into/out of your country.  Since Eurozone is not an emerging market, and the current trend seems to be capital flowing back into the developed economies, I think that diversifying away from silver (at least in overall % of your portfolio) is the order of the day. That said, do I have silver/gold in my retirement portfolio?  Absolutely.  Is it a huge percentage of my portfolio?  Not right now.  However, if the U.S. government fails to resolve the next budget crisis and forces the Federal Reserve to ""print"" money to creatively fund their expenses, then I will be trading out of soft assets classes and into precious metals in order to preserve the ""real value"" of my portfolio in the face of a depreciating USD. As for what to diversify into?  Like the folks above say: ETFs(NOT precious metal ETFs and read all of the fine print, since a number of ETFs cheat), Indexes, Dividend-paying stocks (a favorite of mine, assuming they maintain the dividend), or bonds (after they raise the interest rates).  Once you have your diversification percentages decided, then you just adjust that based on macro-economic trends, in order to avoid pitfalls.

4211,82195,What can we conclude/learn from inst. own %?,"There are a LOT of reasons why institutional investors would own a company's stock (especially a lot of it). Some can be: The company is in one of the indices, especially big ones. Many asset management companies have funds that are either passive (track index) or more-or-less closely adhere to a benchmark, with the benchmark frequently being (based on/exactly) an index. As such, a stock that's part of an index would be heavily owned by institutional investors. Conclusion: Nothing definitive. Being included in an equity index is usually dependent on the market cap; NOT on intrinsic quality of the company, its fundamentals or stock returns.  The company is considered a good prospect (growth or value), in a sector that is popular with institutional investors. There's a certain amount of groupthink in investing. To completely butcher a known IT saying, you don't get fired for investing in AAPL :)  While truly outstanding and successful investors seek NON-popular assets (which would be undervalued), the bulk is likely to go with ""best practices""... and the general rules for valuation and analysis everyone uses are reasonably similar. As such, if one company invests in a stock, it's likely a competitor will follow similar reasoning to invest in it.  Conclusion: Nothing definitive. You don't know if the price at which those institutional companies bought the stock is way lower than now. You don't know if the stock is held for its returns potential, or as part of an index, or some fancy strategy you as individual investor can't follow. The company's technicals lead the algorithms to prefer it. And they feed off of each other. Somewhat similar in spirit to #2, except this time, it's algorithmic trading making decisions based on technicals instead of portfolio managers based on funamentals.  Obviously, same conclusion applies, even more so. The company sold a large part of the stock directly to institutional investor as part of an offering. Sometimes, as part of IPO (ala PNC and BLK), sometimes additional capital raising (ala Buffett and BAC) Conclusion: Nothing definitive. That investor holds on to the investment, sometimes for reason not only directly related to stock performance (e.g. control of the company, or synergies). Also, does the fact that Inst. Own % is high mean that the company is a good investment and/or less risky? Not necessarily. In 2008, Bear Stearns Inst Own. % was 77%",Fake,Real,0.782435953617096,,,,,,,,,,1,0,0

The difference comes over the course of the year. First, Person B is going to be making money from the economic value the company provides over the whole year, while the only way Person A can make money is from market fluctuation (the economic value the company provides over the course of an hour is unlikely to be significant). Person B is exposed to the risk of buying the stock, but that's counterbalanced by the profit from holding the stock for a year, while Person A just has the risk. Second, if Person A is buying a new stock every hour, then they're going to have thousands of transactions.

4244,82576,Can a Company which is listed at OTC and TSX considered to be serious?,"The assumption that companies listed OTC are not serious is far from the truth. Many companies on the OTC are just starting off there because they don't meet the requirements to be listed on the NASDAQ or NYSE. Major stock exchanges like the NASDAQ and the NYSE only want the best companies to trade on their exchanges.The NASDAQ, for example, has three sets of listing requirements. A company must meet at least one of the three requirement sets, as well as the main rules for all companies. These include: Now don't assume that the OTC doesn't have rules either, as this is far from the truth as well. While there are no minimum level of revenue, profits or assets required to get listed on the OTC there are requirements for audited financial statements and ongoing filing and reporting to the SEC and NASD. Additionally there are several different levels of the OTC, including the OTCQX, the OTCCB and the OTC Pink, each with their own set of requirements. For more information about what it takes to be listed on OTC look here: http://www.otcmarkets.com/learn/otc-trading A company deciding to trade on the OTC is making the decision to take their company public, and they are investing to make it happen. Currently the fees to get listed on the OTC range from $30,000 to $150,000 depending on the firm you decide to go with and the services they offer as part as their package. Now, I know I wouldn't consider $30K (or more) to not be serious money! When I looked into the process of getting a company listed on the TSX the requirements seemed a lot more relaxed than those of the major U.S. markets as well, consisting of an application, records submission and then a decision made by a TSX committee about whether you get listed. More information about the TSX here: http://apps.tmx.com/en/listings/listing_with_us/process/index.html I think the way that the OTC markets have gotten such a bad reputation is from these ""Get Rich on Penny Stock"" companies that you see pumping up OTC company stocks and getting massive amounts of people to buy without doing their due diligence and investigating the company and reading its prospectus. Then when they loose a bunch of money on an ill-informed investment decision they blame it on the company being an OTC stock.

4246,82599,Inverse Relationship between Volatility and Beta,"For any isolated equity market, its beta will less resemble the betas of all other interconnected equity markets.  For interconnected markets, beta is not well-dispersed, especially during a world expansion because richer nations have more wealth thus a dominant influence over smaller nations' equity markets causing a convergence.  If the world is in recession, or a country is in recession, all betas or the recessing country's beta will start to diverge, respectively.  If the world's economies diverge, their equity markets' betas will too.  If a country is having financial difficulty, its beta too will diverge. Beta is correlation against a ratio of variance, so variance or ""volatiliy"" is only half of that equation.  Correlation or ""direction"" is the other half.  The ratio of variance will give the magnitude of beta, and correlation will give the sign or ""direction"". Therefore, interconnected emerging equity markets should have higher beta magnitudes because they are more variant but should generally over time have signs that more closely resemble the rest.

The net effect of these two taxable events has   DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES for DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDERS depending upon their   peculiar TAX SITUATIONS. The CORRECT STATEMENT of the tax treatment of unexercised PYLDR rights   is in the N-2 on page 32, which reads in relevant part as follows: “…, if you receive a Subscription Right from PSEC and do not sell or   exercise that right before it expires, you should generally expect to   have (1) taxable dividend income equal to the fair market value (if   any) of the Subscription Right on the date of its distribution by PSEC   to the extent of PSEC’s current and accumulated earnings and profits   and (2) a capital loss upon the expiration of such right in an amount   equal to your adjusted tax basis (if any) in such right (which should   generally equal the fair market value (if any) of the Subscription   Right on the date of its distribution by PSEC).” Please note, for quarterly “estimated taxes” purposes, that the   DIVIDEND taxable events occur “ON THE DATE OF ITS DISTRIBUTION BY PSEC   (my emphasis),” while the CAPITAL LOSS occurs “UPON EXPIRATION OF SUCH   RIGHT” (my emphasis). They do NOT occur on 31 December 2015 or some   other date. However, to my knowledge, neither of the taxable events he mentions would be taxed by 4/15.

4250,82666,Why was S&P 500 PE Ratio so high on May 2009,"Asking why the p/e was so high is best answered ""because reported earnings were so low"". Recall that the S&P500 bottomed in early March 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion.  As noted on the page you have linked, the reported p/e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months.  During those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value.  This meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings.  Since the financial sector is a large part of the S&P500, this alone had an enormous effect on the index p/e.  However, the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty.  The same site reports earnings for the previous years at $17.11 for the S&P500, compared to $76.17 for the year prior to 2008.  That is a collapse of about 78% in earnings.  Although the S&P500 has suffered badly during this time, stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by May 2009.  Indeed, the S&P500 was up about 33% in just two months, from its low in March2009 to mid May2009.  Thus, by May of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings.

You may have noticed that there are a lot of really financially savvy people who are not billionaires. So the math for your plan falls apart somewhere, obviously. However, in the spirit of being helpful, and with the caveat that super high returns involve super high risk I'll try and point you in the direction where this is theoretically possible, even if the odds would be better buying lottery tickets. One way to get more leverage from your money than just buying stocks is to buy options. With an options strategy your return/loss will be magnified greatly compared to buying stocks.

4253,82724,few question about debit credit and liabilities ,"Exactly what accounts are affected by any given transaction is not a fixed thing. Just for example, in a simple accounting system you might have one account for ""stock on hand"". In a more complex system you might have this broken out into many accounts for different types of stock, stock in different locations, etc. So I can only suggest example specific accounts. But account type -- asset, liability, capital (or ""equity""), income, expense -- should be universal. Debit and credit rules should be universal. 1: Sold product on account: You say it cost you $500 to produce. You don't say the selling price, but let's say it's, oh, $700. Credit (decrease) Asset ""Stock on hand"" by $500. Debit (increase) Asset ""Accounts receivable"" by $700. Credit (increase) Income ""Sales"" by $700. Debit (increase) Expense ""Cost of goods sold"" by $500. 2: $1000 spent on wedding party by friend I'm not sure how your friend's expenses affect your accounts. Are you asking how he would record this expense? Did you pay it for him? Are you expecting him to pay you back? Did he pay with cash, check, a credit card, bought on credit? I just don't know what's happening here. But just for example, if you're asking how your friend would record this in his own records, and if he paid by check: Credit (decrease) Asset ""checking account"" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense ""wedding expenses"" by $1000. If he paid with a credit card: Credit (increase) Liability ""credit card"" by $1000. Debit (increase) Expense ""wedding expenses"" by $1000. When he pays off the credit card: Debit (decrease) Liability ""credit card"" by $1000. Credit (decrease) Asset ""cash"" by $1000. (Or more realistically, there are other expenses on the credit card and the amount would be higher.) 3: Issue $3000 in stock to partner company I'm a little shakier on this, I haven't worked with the stock side of accounting. But here's my best stab: Well, did you get anything in return? Like did they pay you for the stock? I wouldn't think you would just give someone stock as a present. If they paid you cash for the stock: Debit (increase) Asset ""cash"". Credit (decrease) Capital ""shareholder equity"". Anyone else want to chime in on that one, I'm a little shaky there. Here, let me give you the general rules. My boss years ago described it to me this way: You only need to know three things to understand double-entry accounting: 1: There are five types of accounts: Assets: anything you have that has value, like cash, buildings, equipment, and merchandise. Includes things you may not actually have in your hands but that are rightly yours, like money people owe you but haven't yet paid. Liabilities: Anything you owe to someone else. Debts, merchandise paid for but not yet delivered, and taxes due. Capital (some call it ""capital"", others call it ""equity""): The difference between Assets and Liabilities. The owners investment in the company, retained earnings, etc. Income: Money coming in, the biggest being sales. Expenses: Money going out, like salaries to employees, cost of purchasing merchandise for resale, rent, electric bill, taxes, etc. Okay, that's a big ""one thing"". 2: Every transaction must update two or more accounts. Each update is either a ""debit"" or a ""credit"". The total of the debits must equal the total of the credits. 3: A dollar bill in your pocket is a debit.

You may need to take a higher rate in the short term but hopefully you can refinance in a few years to a more reasonable rate. Check with a local bank or credit union.  Many times local banks or CU's will finance high demand properties that may be out of favor with the super banks that have no ties to your community.  These banks sometimes realize that just because the standard spreadsheet says this is a bad risk the reality is the specific property you are interested in is not the risk that it appears on paper.  You will have to find a bank that actually retains its mortgages as many local banks have become agents that just sell mortgages to the mortgage market. Talk to a Realtor.

As Jason R has pointed out, 1-2 trades a year for 7 years would only give you 7-14 trades. In order to get a success rate of 96% you would have had to successful exploit this ""irregularity"" at 24 out of 25 times.   I recommend you proceed cautiously. Make the transition from a paper trader to a profit-seeking trader slowly. Use a low leverage ratio until you can make several more successful trades and then slowly increase your leverage as you gain confidence.

A bronschopy may be required after the HRCT scan.Blood tests: Complete hemogram, Liver function tests, ACE level, IgE, Urea Creatinine, ANA, ANCA are also required.A treatment plan can be decided only after these tests are done.I hope that was useful.Best Wishes.",Fake,Real,0.99835205078125,,,,,,,,,,1,0,1

I took a test last week it was negative.  I have a slight white discharge.

Women sometimes don't ovulate at the same time as usual, and other factors, such as weight changes, travel, and stress, can also make your cycle abnormal.Furthermore, in your particular case, your husband has been sterilized.  And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown",Real,Fake,0.9997511506080629,,,,,,,,,,0,1,1
